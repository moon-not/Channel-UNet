	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using Java and Kotlin with Eclipse Collections to solve the Donut Kata&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HWZ5f9pdBxQRbIfZ&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@slashiotarhini?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&quot;&gt;Ali Tarhini&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Donut Kata&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the Kotlin programming language, I thought I would share the solutions to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BNYMellon/CodeKatas/tree/master/donut-kata&quot;&gt;Donut Code Kata&lt;/a&gt; using both &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BNYMellon/CodeKatas/tree/master/donut-kata-solutions/src/main/java/bnymellon/codekatas/donutkata&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; 16 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BNYMellon/CodeKatas/tree/master/donut-kata-solutions/src/main/kotlin/bnymellon/codekatas/donutkatakotlin&quot;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt; 1.5.0 with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt; 11.0.0.M2. The purpose of the Donut Kata is to help familiarize developers with lesser known methods in the Eclipse Collections API. Eclipse Collections is a Java library, so it works well in both Java and Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Donut Kata Domain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domain of the Donut Kata is a Donut Shop. You make donuts, take orders for donuts, and deliver donuts. The domain is implemented in both Java 16 and Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-GIcdC9rUjscdyzUEdY9Lg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Donut Shop Domain Classes&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Donut is a Record or a Data Class&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote the Donut kata almost four years ago, and it has been upgraded over the years from Java 8 to Java 10, 14, 15, and now 16. In Java 16, we finally have records as a first class feature. I upgraded the Kotlin stdlib version to 1.5.0 today and changed the Donut class to a data class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java 16:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;public record Donut(DonutType type, double price) {}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kotlin 1.5.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;data class Donut(val &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;: DonutType, val &lt;strong&gt;price&lt;/strong&gt;: Double)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;DonutType is an enum in both &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BNYMellon/CodeKatas/blob/master/donut-kata-solutions/src/main/java/bnymellon/codekatas/donutkata/DonutType.java&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BNYMellon/CodeKatas/blob/master/donut-kata-solutions/src/main/kotlin/bnymellon/codekatas/donutkatakotlin/DonutType.kt&quot;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;. Click the links to see the differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;There is no try&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not going to teach you Java 16, Kotlin 1.5.0 or Eclipse Collections 11.0.0.M2 in this blog. The best way to learn and compare these is to complete the kata on your own. Experiment with different features if you like. Solve the kata using Java Streams or Kotlin’s collections. The Donut Kata is a non-trivial domain that can help you learn different features of both the Java and Kotlin programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do or Donut.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BNYMellon/CodeKatas/blob/master/donut-kata/README.md&quot;&gt;README.md&lt;/a&gt; will help you get started. You will want to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BNYMellon/CodeKatas&quot;&gt;Code Katas&lt;/a&gt; and work on them in the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA. There are failing unit tests in both the Java and Kotlin versions of the Kata. You complete the kata by using methods from the Eclipse Collections API in the domain classes where the code is currently missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck and Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a Project Lead and Committer for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; OSS project at the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is open for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;contributions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. If you like the library, you can let us know by starring it on GitHub.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=2bdce3678506&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Originally posted on October 26/2017. This post is based on a talk that Gunnar Wagenknecht and I delivered at the Open Source Leadership Summit 2017 and Devoxx US 2017. This content was published in the All Eyes on Open Source issue of JAX Magazine.
Running an open source project is easy. All you have to do is make your source code available and youâ€™re open source, right? Well, maybe. Ultimately, whether or not an open source project is successful depends on your definition of success.</description>

	<title>Mike Milinkovich: On Patents and Specifications</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://eclipse-foundation.blog/?p=1598</guid>
	<link>https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2021/05/13/on-patents-and-specifications/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been fielding a number of questions lately about the intersection of our spec process and patents. A couple of these community discussions have gone off in directions that are off target, factually incorrect, or both. Therefore, the purpose of this short FAQ is to explain the patent license options provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Eclipse_IP_Policy.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation Intellectual Property Policy&lt;/a&gt; for use by specifications developed by specification projects under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation Specification Process&lt;/a&gt; (EFSP). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/strong&gt;This is not legal advice. I am not a lawyer. It has not been reviewed by counsel. Consult your own attorney. In addition, this note does not form part of any official Eclipse Foundation policy or process, but rather is provided for informational purposes only to aid those involved in our specification projects to better understand the EFSP and the choices available. I’ll update the content as needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One important point to keep in mind when reading this: we believe that the EFSP fully complies with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/osr&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Standards Requirement for Software&lt;/a&gt; established by the Open Source Initiative. In other words, the EFSP is designed specifically to be open source friendly.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do specifications require patent licenses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The purpose of every specification is to stimulate the development of implementations. These implementations may be derived from open source code maintained at the Eclipse Foundation or elsewhere, or they may be independently developed. They may be made available under open source licenses or proprietary. In order to facilitate and encourage these implementations, all specification processes provide some notion of patent licenses from the parties involved in developing the specifications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What types of patent licenses are used by various specification organizations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are a wide variety of specification patent license options available from various sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some terms that you may hear are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;FRAND means fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory licenses. This means that before you can implement the specification you are required to obtain a license from the patent holders who developed the specification. FRAND is generally considered to be antithetical to open source development, as it requires permission and money to implement a specification or potentially even to use an implementation of such a specification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;FRAND-Z is FRAND where the cost of the license is set to zero. Note that although this removes the cost concerns of FRAND, permission may still be required for use and/or implementation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RF or royalty-free provides &lt;em&gt;a priori &lt;/em&gt;royalty-free licenses from the participants developing the specifications to downstream users and implementers. This is considered a best practice for enabling open source implementations of a specification. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;All Eclipse Foundation specifications are developed on a royalty-free basis.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-assert is another legal mechanism which provides a result effectively similar to royalty-free. A non-assert says that a patent holder will not assert their patent rights against an implementer or user. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do these licenses mean that an implementer or user can never be sued for patent infringement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No. The patent licenses are intended to ensure that an implementer or user doesn’t need to be worried about being sued by the parties involved in developing the specifications. It does not provide protection from uninvolved third parties who may believe they have intellectual property rights applicable to the specification. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that the above implies that it is in the interests of the entire community and ecosystem that many participants (particularly patent-owning participants) be involved in developing the specifications. It also explains why it is in the best interest of the community that all participants in the specification process have signed agreements in place documenting their commitment to the patent licensing under the EFSP. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What patent licenses are granted by the EFSP?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patent licenses provided via the EFSP apply to all downstream implementations of Final Specifications, including independent implementations. They cover all patents owned by each Participant in the specification project that are essential claims needed by any implementer or user of the specification. Note that the licenses cover the entire specification, not just to the parts of the specification that a participant may have contributed to. We provide our specifications two options for patent licenses: the Compatible Patent License and the Implementation Patent License. The differences between those two are explained below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But my open source license already has a patent license in it. Why do I need more than that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patent licenses provided in open source licenses such as APACHE-2.0 grant a license for contributor-owned patents which apply to their contribution either alone or as combined with the work. The patent license is only to that program/implementation. Note that the APACHE-2.0 patent license  “…&lt;em&gt;applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work&lt;/em&gt;…”. Relative to the EFSP, such grants are deficient in both scope (applies only to their contributions) and target (applies only to that implementation). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between the two patent license options provided by the EFSP?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The only difference between the Compatible Patent License and and the Implementation Patent License is the timing of when the patent license grant comes into effect. In the Compatible Patent License, the license grant only happens when the implementation has demonstrated that it is fully compatible with the specification by passing the relevant TCK. The Implementation Patent License provides immediate patent licenses to all implementers, even to partial or work-in-progress implementations. The first choice emphasizes the importance of compatibility. The latter choice emphasizes the importance of open development. Both are valuable options available to Eclipse specification projects. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve read the EFSP and I don’t see anything about patent licenses. WUWT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patent licenses are provided in the Eclipse Foundation Intellectual Property Policy. A future version of the EFSP will make this clearer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Eclipse Foundation itself granted any licenses to patents? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No. The Eclipse Foundation itself does not acquire any patent rights in the specifications. The patent licenses are granted from the participating patent owners directly to implementers and users of those specifications. More specifically, the patent license grants are “… &lt;em&gt;to everyone to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, and impor&lt;/em&gt;t…” implementations of the specifications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Mike Milinkovich: Eclipse ioFog 2.0 Takes Us to the Next Era of EdgeOps</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://eclipse-foundation.blog/?p=1594</guid>
	<link>https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2021/05/13/eclipse-iofog-2-0-takes-us-to-the-next-era-of-edgeops/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the Eclipse ioFog project team announced the release of&lt;a href=&quot;https://iofog.org/releases.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Eclipse ioFog 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, and I invite everyone to join me in congratulating them and the&lt;a href=&quot;https://edgenative.eclipse.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Eclipse Edge Native Working Group&lt;/a&gt; for the achievement. Thanks to the community’s efforts, the release delivers new EdgeOps functionality that makes it faster and easier to develop production-grade edge applications and manage edge AI deployments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href=&quot;https://iofog.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; ioFog&lt;/a&gt; platform brings cloud native architectures such as Kubernetes to the edge, allowing developers to deploy, orchestrate, and manage microservices on any edge device. It’s unique in the industry because it abstracts the complexities of networking from the edge applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse ioFog platform is already widely used and proven in the field. Organizations ranging from major service providers to FORTUNE 500 companies all rely on the software in production environments today. The ioFog platform has even been used as the backbone of an edge AI application that monitors children’s temperatures and use of masks in schools to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. It’s a great example of the value and potential the ioFog platform delivers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EdgeOps Targets Edge Computing Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new EdgeOps capabilities in Eclipse ioFog 2.0 take that value and potential to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;EdgeOps technologies and tools are built from the ground up to address the unique challenges that arise when developing edge computing applications. They’re needed because traditional DevOps technologies and tools are not well-suited to edge computing. The EdgeOps concept was defined by the Eclipse Edge Native Working Group, and the Eclipse ioFog platform is a key enabling technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief look at what the new EdgeOps features in Eclipse ioFog 2.0 mean for developers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Hat’s Skupper Project Simplifies Application Connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse ioFog architecture is based on the concept of an Edge Compute Network (ECN) that’s comprised of a Controller, Agents (more on this later), and a Service Mesh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Eclipse ioFog 2.0, the Service Mesh component was replaced with Red Hat’s Skupper project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Skupper uses the Apache Qpid Dispatch Router for application connectivity between data centers and any type of edge with no need for virtual private networks (VPNs) or special firewall rules. As a result, developers can now set up application connections using a simple yaml configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Features Enable More Fluid EdgeOps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eclipse ioFog 2.0 also includes new features that give developers more flexible and adaptable EdgeOps capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, developers can now add, remove, and move ioFog Agents between ECNs at runtime. Agents are lightweight, universal container runtimes that are installed on edge devices to manage the life cycle of microservices, data volumes, edge resources, and other assets. With Eclipse ioFog 2.0, developers have new agility to take advantage of live orchestration, and to migrate and drain microservices and applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers also have new abilities to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;·      Prune images based on policies&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;·      Manage multiple image registries&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;·      Mount data volumes in microservices containers&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, these features showcase the Edge Native community’s ability to deliver the production-ready features edge application developers need to support real-world use cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn More and Get Started With Eclipse ioFog 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Patrick Paulin: Bringing Chromium to Eclipse RCP</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.modumind.com/?p=6177</guid>
	<link>https://www.modumind.com/2021/05/12/bringing-chromium-to-eclipse-rcp/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=bringing-chromium-to-eclipse-rcp</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions I’m asked by my clients is whether it’s possible to utilize web-based UI frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, etc.) in an Eclipse RCP application. Until now, my answer has been no, largely because of the limitations of the SWT &lt;code&gt;Browser&lt;/code&gt; control. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well I’m happy to say that things are starting to change in this area, though there is still much work to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;New SWT support for Microsoft Edge Chromium&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2018 Microsoft made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527550/microsoft-chromium-edge-google-history-collaboration&quot;&gt;surprising decision to base its future Edge browser on Chromium&lt;/a&gt;. Support for Edge Chromium is now available in one of two forms – the Edge browser itself and the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/&quot;&gt;WebView2&lt;/a&gt; control. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The WebView2 control is of particular interest because it allows for the embedding of web-based UI elements into native applications. And I’m happy to say that as of the 2021-03 Eclipse release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=538991&quot;&gt;we can now embed this control in Eclipse RCP applications&lt;/a&gt;. While of course limited to the Win32 platform, this support for Chromium in Eclipse RCP makes it possible to fully leverage your web-based UI framework of choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To try this out, you’ll need to do two things:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/&quot;&gt;WebView2 runtime&lt;/a&gt; (the Edge browser is not required). There are a variety of options for installing the runtime, and I think this situation will continue to evolve. Long-term, Microsoft is going to rely heavily on this control in their application suite and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/webview2-install&quot;&gt;is now deploying the control along with it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In your SWT &lt;code&gt;Browser&lt;/code&gt; control, pass the &lt;code&gt;SWT.EDGE&lt;/code&gt; flag in the constructor.  Alternatively, you can pass this argument on the command line: &lt;code&gt;-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=edge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple Eclipse RCP application using the Edge Chromium browser.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6180&quot; height=&quot;398&quot; src=&quot;https://www.modumind.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/edge-example.png&quot; width=&quot;623&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The work left to do&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Support for the WebView2 control in SWT is still experimental, and there’s a short but growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=571909&quot;&gt;list of bugs/enhancement requests&lt;/a&gt;. Also, here is a list of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#edgelimitations&quot;&gt;known limitations&lt;/a&gt; of the SWT control. Some of these limitations need to be addressed by Microsoft (in particular support for getting/setting cookies) and they are making good progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course the biggest issue is that this is not a cross-platform solution. So what about MacOS and Linux?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Cross-platform Chromium&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was an attempt made over the past few years to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=549585&quot;&gt;create cross-platform Chromium support in SWT&lt;/a&gt;. This support was based on using Rust to wrap the Chromium framework with platform specific controls that would be accessible to SWT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=572010&quot;&gt;this effort has recently been abandoned&lt;/a&gt;. My take is that the problem was ultimately a lack of developer support. Without strong developer interest and engagement, the effort was not going to succeed. The Eclipse Platform PMC is still open to the idea of a cross-platform Chromium control, perhaps in the form of a Nebula contribution. So if you’re interested in picking up this work and running with it, let them know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another possible solution is that Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues/645&quot;&gt;releases WebView2 controls for MacOS and Linux&lt;/a&gt; . Then the SWT support for this control could be made available for all Eclipse RCP deployment platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is definitely early days for Chromium support in Eclipse RCP applications, but I see a clear path forward. My hope is that in the near future Eclipse RCP developers will have access to robust cross-platform Chromium support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And once that happens, the opportunities for utilizing Eclipse RCP become very interesting. Eclipse RCP applications would be well-suited to host modular microservices in the UI (sometimes called &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html&quot;&gt;Micro Frontends&lt;/a&gt;). And if these microservices were written using web-frameworks running on Chromium, they could easily be migrated to or co-hosted by other Chromium-based frameworks such as Electron.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that’s a story for another day &lt;img alt=&quot;ðŸ™‚&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re excited to introduce you to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://entrepreneurialopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Entrepreneurial Open Source Podcast&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This show aims to uncover valuable practical insights about building business through open source participation and commercial innovation. By speaking to people who are giving back to open source communities while running successful businesses, we hope to inform, engage, and inspire other entrepreneurs who are on the same journey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the coming months, you’ll hear my co-host &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gblondelle&quot;&gt;Gael Blondelle&lt;/a&gt; and I speaking with open source entrepreneurs in industrial IoT (IIoT), edge computing, artificial intelligence, developer tools, and more. We are lucky to be able to tap into a global community of tech and business leaders at the Eclipse Foundation and proud to share their stories and experiences of leadership in industrial open source with you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disrupting Industrial Automation Through Open Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our first guest is Don Pearson, Inductive Automation’s Chief Strategy Officer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://inductiveautomation.com/&quot;&gt;Inductive Automation&lt;/a&gt; is a leading industrial automation software vendor, and a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/&quot;&gt;Eclipse IoT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sparkplug.eclipse.org/&quot;&gt;Sparkplug&lt;/a&gt; working groups. Don and I discussed how the company started, and how a lack of transparency from some software companies pushed them to take a new approach with their technology, business, and licensing models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Inductive Automation has leveraged their commitment to open source, interoperability, and open standards to deliver the Ignition application platform for SCADA and IIoT solutions. In sectors ranging from food and beverage to oil and gas, Inductive Automation’s partners and end customers are able to build on the Ignition platform and trusted standards like MQTT and OPC UA to implement industrial applications and achieve their business objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Don says the flexibility and freedom that open source creates is key to the success of their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;rteindent1&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There’s no way we could do what we do with our technology without our connection to open source and the model that it puts out there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;” &lt;/strong&gt;— Don Pearson, Inductive Automation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We hope you enjoy the episode! Listen to it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/entrepreneurial-open-source/id1565557488&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/2761dva13JIQKvaUzgqchQ&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xNzQwMjkxLnJzcw&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wayne Beaton: Progress and Release Reviews</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.waynebeaton.ca/posts/edp/progress-and-release-reviews/</guid>
	<link>http://blog.waynebeaton.ca/posts/edp/progress-and-release-reviews/</link>
	<description>The Eclipse Foundation Development Process (EDP) describes a release as anything that is distributed for adoption outside of the committers of a project (effectively, if you stamp something with a version number and tell the general audience to download it, it’s a release). Appropriately labeled nightly, integration, and milestone builds are not considered releases.
Further, the EDP describes a requirement for all Eclipse projects to engage in a review prior to creating a release.</description>

	<title>Brian King: Eclipse Theia Builds Momentum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">6980 at https://blogs.eclipse.org</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/brian-king/eclipse-theia-builds-momentum</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;&quot;&gt;Theia Today &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;The Eclipse Theia project was born just 4 years ago. Kudos and thanks to all the organizations that have supported and built the project into the success that it is today. In addition to these original contributors, there continues to be significant growth in the number of companies contributing to and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ecdtools.eclipse.org/adopters/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;adopting Theia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; as the basis for their custom IDEs and domain-specific tools. Because of our active and vibrant community, Theia is now a thriving and diverse project — ready to move to the next level of growth and adoption. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;Theia is an open source, extensible and adaptable platform that provides very similar capabilities to Visual Studio (VS) Code, while offering more flexibility to be tailored to specific use cases. This means you can build tools that are very similar to VS Code, but also completely white label and customize the workbench. All of this, of course, available as a browser and/or as a desktop application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;Theia is also compatible with VS Code, so Microsoft VS Code extensions can be leveraged through the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open-vsx.org/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Open VSX Registry&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; — enabling the use of the biggest ecosystem of additional development features available today. This means that with Theia, organizations and vendors building cloud and desktop IDEs, have a production-ready, vendor-neutral, and open source framework for creating customized development environments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;Let’s now take a look at the current project state, starting with some notable examples of project adoption, as well as the companies behind those initiatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #434343; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt;&quot;&gt;Arduino IDE 2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/system/files/blogs/IDE2_beta5_05_debugger.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Arduino IDE 2.0&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/system/files/blogs/IDE2_beta5_05_debugger.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/getting-started-with-ide-v2&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arduino IDE 2.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; is an evolution of the popular IDE used to program any Arduino board. In addition to a modern editor and a more responsive interface, the IDE 2.0 also includes some advanced features for professional users: autocompletion, code navigation, and live debugger. The Arduino IDE is a good example of what’s possible with Theia as a platform. As you can see in the screenshot above, some parts of the UI are fully tailored, such as the toolbar. Other parts, such as the code editor (Monaco) are similar to what you see with VS Code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #434343; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt;&quot;&gt;Arm Mbed Studio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/system/files/blogs/Arm_MbedStudio.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Arm Mbed Studio&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/system/files/blogs/Arm_MbedStudio.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;Mbed Studio is a local development environment for Mbed OS, giving developers all the tools and dependencies needed to create C/C++ IoT applications for Arm Cortex-M based hardware. Mbed Studio is one of several examples that show how well Theia fits the needs of tooling for embedded programming. Mbed Studio leverages Theia’s compatibility with VS Code extensions to reuse some existing language features for C/C++, while  also heavily customizing the workbench in some areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #434343; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt;&quot;&gt;EclipseSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/system/files/blogs/image5.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;EclipseSource&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/system/files/blogs/image5.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;EclipseSource is a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/services/tools/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;service provider for tool development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; and provides &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/technology/eclipse-theia/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consulting and implementation services as well as training for Eclipse Theia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;. EclipseSource does not provide their own Theia-based tools, but they do support various customers in implementing their own solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;EclipseSource also provides a comprehensive open source example tool based on Eclipse Theia called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/emfcloud/#coffeeeditoroverview&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the coffee editor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;. This tool, shown in the screenshot above, combines Theia with other Eclipse technologies such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/emfcloud&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;EMF.cloud&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/glsp/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eclipse GLSP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Xtext&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jsonforms.io/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;JSON Forms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; and many more. The tool is provided as an online demo, so if you want to see what is possible with Theia + the Eclipse Cloud DevTools ecosystem, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/emfcloud/#coffeeeditoroverview&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;check it out&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #434343; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt;&quot;&gt;Logi.cloud by logi.cals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The experience is as fast and familiar as an integrated development environment on your laptop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;address&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Che and Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces offer Kubernetes-native development environments. Eclipse Theia means developers need only a web browser to access a feature-rich IDE, and benefit from a similar look-and-feel and shared extensions with VS Code. As an open source community project, Che developers have been able to collaborate and contribute to Eclipse Theia, and together help build a better experience for users of cloud development tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; - David Harris | Principal Product Manager, Developer Tooling at Red Hat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/address&gt;

The TypeFox team laid the groundwork for Theia in order to provide a platform on which custom applications can be built.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #434343; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt;&quot;&gt;...and More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;This is just a sampling of some of the great tools built on Theia along with the services available in a flourishing ecosystem. Noteworthy shoutouts for other products based on Theia go to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/shell/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Cloud Shell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acquia.com/products/drupal-cloud/cloud-ide&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Acquia’s Drupal Cloud IDE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;. This is just the visible tip of the proverbial iceberg. As is often the case for open source projects, most adopters stay hidden. So, if there is a project you know of that uses Theia and is not listed on our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ecdtools.eclipse.org/adopters/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adopters page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;, please let us know by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-project-adopters/issues&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;opening an issue&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;&quot;&gt;Noteworthy Initiatives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;Because the Theia project has such an extensive reach, it would go beyond the scope of this post to mention all ongoing developments. With this in mind, I would like to focus on three initiatives that I find rather interesting: VS Code extension compatibility; the Open VSX marketplace; and Theia Blueprint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #434343; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt;&quot;&gt;VS Code Compatibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;There are a number of interesting pieces in the Theia tech stack (which would warrant a separate post). One of the crucial pieces is work being done around APIs for VS Code extensions that provide compatibility with thousands of available FOSS extensions. Theia supports VS Code extensions through its Plugin system, which is regularly updated to the most recent VS Code extension API. Related to this, the Monaco Editor is a key component of Theia, and adapting and keeping it up-to-date is a huge achievement by the project. Having these core pieces (with more to come), makes Theia a modern application framework for building innovative developer tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #434343; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt;&quot;&gt;Open VSX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;There is strong demand for a fully open alternative to the Visual Studio Marketplace, and the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open-vsx.org/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Open VSX Registry&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; meets that demand. It offers a community driven, fully open platform for publishing VS Code extensions. The Registry is built on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Eclipse Open VSX&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;, which is an open source project hosted at the Eclipse Foundation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;Open VSX is integrated into multiple software applications that support VS Code extensions, including many that are Theia-based. If you need to have your own extension gallery, for example in a protected corporate environment, you can do this with Open VSX. Having VS Code extensions available ensures that your Theia-based product is a platform for innovation and customization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #434343; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt;&quot;&gt;Theia Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;We’ve recently seen the alpha release of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theia-ide.org/docs/blueprint_download&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Theia Blueprint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;, a template to help potential adopters jumpstart their Theia-based projects. It provides installers for all major operating systems so you can easily download, try and build on Theia locally. More details can be found in my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/brian-king/eclipse-theia-blueprint-now-available-download&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent blog post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt;&quot;&gt;What’s Next for Theia? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;Theia continues its growth in terms of adoption, but also in terms of the underlying ecosystem. In just the past three months, there have been more than 50 individual &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.theia/who&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;committers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;, from eight different companies. Theia is clearly not a one man or one company show, it is based on a very diverse ecosystem of contributors. If you visit the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.theia-ide.org/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Theia community forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;, you’ll see posts regularly from developers asking questions related to work they are doing on their Theia-based tools. This gives a hint about the huge number of unknown adopters, the so-called “dark matter”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;It’s exciting to see a vibrant ecosystem flourish. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;Other &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ecdtools.eclipse.org/projects&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;projects of the Eclipse Cloud DevTools ecosystem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; augment the Theia ecosystem, e.g. the Open VSX Registry, Eclipse Che for workspace hosting, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/glsp/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eclipse GLSP for diagrams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/emfcloud/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;EMF.cloud for domain-specific tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;o see what is coming next, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/wiki/Roadmap&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;check out the roadmap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; which is updated quarterly. The roadmap is a moving snapshot that shows priorities of contributing organizations. Common goals are discussed weekly at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/wiki/Dev-Meetings&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Theia Dev Meeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; and additional capabilities and features identified there will make it onto the roadmap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;Sounds interesting? Take a look at the project to evaluate how to get involved. The best places to look first are the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;GitHub project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt; and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.theia-ide.org/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;community forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Eclipse Ditto: Announcing Eclipse Ditto Release 2.0.0</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/2021-05-06-release-announcement-200.html</guid>
	<link>https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/2021-05-06-release-announcement-200.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, ~1.5 years after release &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/2019-12-12-release-announcement-100.html&quot;&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;, the Eclipse Ditto team is happy to 
announce the availability of Eclipse Ditto &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.ditto/releases/2.0.0&quot;&gt;2.0.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the major version 2.0.0 the Ditto team removed technical debt and ended support for APIs which were deprecated 
long ago in order to have a better maintainable codebase. However some awesome new features are included as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adoption&quot;&gt;Adoption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are willing to show their adoption of Eclipse Ditto publicly: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/#iot.ditto&quot;&gt;https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/?#iot.ditto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our various &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/feedback.html&quot;&gt;feedback channels&lt;/a&gt; we however know of more adoption.&lt;br /&gt;
If you are making use of Eclipse Ditto, it would be great to show this by adding your company name to that list of 
known adopters.&lt;br /&gt;
In the end, that’s one main way of measuring the success of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changelog&quot;&gt;Changelog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main improvements and additions of Ditto 2.0.0 are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merge/PATCH updates of digital twins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configurable OpenID Connect / OAuth2.0 claim extraction to be used for authorization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establishing connections to endpoints (via AMQP, MQTT, HTTP) utilizing a Ditto managed SSH tunnel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addition of a DevOps API in order to retrieve all known connections&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expiring policy subjects + publishing of announcement message prior to expiry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addition of policy actions in order to inject a policy subject based on a provided JWT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built-in acknowledgement for search updates to have the option of twin updates with strong consistency of the search index&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restoring active connection faster after a hard restart of the Ditto cluster via automatic prioritization of connections&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for LastWill/Testament + retain flag for MQTT connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The step to a major version was done because of the following breaking API changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removal of “API version 1” (deprecated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/release_notes_110.html#deprecations&quot;&gt;Ditto 1.1.0&lt;/a&gt;)
from Ditto’s Java APIs + HTTP API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removal of code in Java APIs marked as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Deprecated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Binary incompatible changes to Java APIs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restructuring of Ditto’s Maven modules in order to simplify/ease further development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following non-functional enhancements are also included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvement of stability during rolling updates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addition of sharding concept for Ditto internal pub/sub enabling connection of e.g. tens of thousands Websocket sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Background cleanup improvements in order to have less impact on DB roundtrip times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update of third party libraries (e.g. Akka)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation of deployment via K3S&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/release_notes_200.html&quot;&gt;2.0.0 release notes&lt;/a&gt; for a more detailed information on the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;artifacts&quot;&gt;Artifacts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Java artifacts have been published at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/ditto/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Maven repository&lt;/a&gt;
as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/ditto/&quot;&gt;Maven central&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ditto JavaScript client release was published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/~eclipse_ditto&quot;&gt;npmjs.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-ditto/ditto-javascript-client-dom&quot;&gt;@eclipse-ditto/ditto-javascript-client-dom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eclipse-ditto/ditto-javascript-client-node&quot;&gt;@eclipse-ditto/ditto-javascript-client-node&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Docker images have been pushed to Docker Hub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-policies/&quot;&gt;eclipse/ditto-policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-things/&quot;&gt;eclipse/ditto-things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-things-search/&quot;&gt;eclipse/ditto-things-search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-gateway/&quot;&gt;eclipse/ditto-gateway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-connectivity/&quot;&gt;eclipse/ditto-connectivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/eclipse/ditto-concierge/&quot;&gt;eclipse/ditto-concierge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	<title>Tanja Obradovic: Jakarta EE Community Update for March and April 2021</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">6977 at https://blogs.eclipse.org</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/tanja-obradovic/jakarta-ee-community-update-march-and-april-2021</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our update this month is jam-packed with highlights, as March and April were busy with many events and new developments in the Jakarta EE Community! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The highlights for the past two months are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Jakarta EE 2021 Developer Survey is now open!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is that time of the year: the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/F9CV3LL&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE 2021 Developer Survey&lt;/a&gt; is now open until May 31st&lt;/strong&gt;. Please, if you haven't already provided your response, I encourage you to do so now. Help us gather input from the wider java enterprise community and shape the future of Jakarta EE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are insights for 2020 Jakarta EE Developer Survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/documents/insights/2020-Jakarta-EE-Developer-Survey-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/sites/default/files/users/user180/DevSurvey2020.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 221px; width: 400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Jakarta EE community and Working Group is growing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; We continue to have steady membership growth, and more interest from JUGs to be closely involved in various Jakarta EE projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE Working Group welcomes iJUG as a participant member and Istanbul JUG as a guest member!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iJUG &lt;/strong&gt;involvement in Jakarta EE is well known, as their members are actively involved in Jakarta EE projects and community events. Now they have officially become members of not just Jakarta EE Working Group, but both MicroProfile and Adoptium Working Groups as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/sites/default/files/users/user180/iJUG.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 118px; width: 187px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUG Istanbul&lt;/strong&gt; has joined as a Guest member also. JUG Istanbul is a driving force behind  &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakartaone.org/2021/turkish&quot;&gt;Jakarta One Livestream - Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, and its members are interested in being involved in advancing following individual specifications &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/&quot;&gt;Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency/&quot;&gt;Jakarta Concurrency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/sites/default/files/users/user180/JUGIstanbul.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 156px; width: 140px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is a call to other JUGs to explore the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/membership/&quot;&gt;joining Jakarta EE Working Group&lt;/a&gt;. Approach us and let us know if membership is something you would be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE 9.1 release&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are all already familiar with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/jakartaee9/JakartaEE9.1ReleasePlan&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE 9.1 Release Plan&lt;/a&gt;! The main driver for this release is Java SE 11 support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Eclipse GlassFish 6.1.0-RC1 Web (&lt;a href=&quot;https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/glassfish/web-6.1.0-RC1.zip%20)%20&quot;&gt;https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/glassfish/web-6.1.0-RC1.zip )&lt;/a&gt;  and Full Profile (&lt;a href=&quot;https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/glassfish/glassfish-6.1.0-RC1.zip&quot;&gt;https://download.eclipse.org/ee4j/glassfish/glassfish-6.1.0-RC1.zip&lt;/a&gt;)  are now on Eclipse downloads. Please download and take a look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multiple Compatible Products on the release date of the Jakarta EE 9.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue+9.1+label%3Acertification+is%3Aopen&quot;&gt; compatibility certification request for Jakarta EE 9.1 release&lt;/a&gt; keep coming, and we are super proud and happy about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/sites/default/files/users/user180/CCR9.1.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 600px; width: 628px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Jakarta EE 9.1 release will be the first release that will have more than one compatible implementation used for the ratification of the final specification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE Individual Specifications and project teams &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have organized a public calendar Jakarta EE Specifications Calendar (&lt;a href=&quot;https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=eclipse-foundation.org_e9ki8t2gc75sh07qdh95c8ofvc%40group.calendar.google.com&quot;&gt;public url&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/eclipse-foundation.org_e9ki8t2gc75sh07qdh95c8ofvc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics&quot;&gt; iCal&lt;/a&gt;) to display all Jakarta EE Specification project teams meetings. Everyone interested is welcome to join the calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jakarta EE Platform team (meeting on&lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/minutes/2021-02-09.html&quot;&gt; Feb 9th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;) has invited all specification project team members and leads to submit their release plans for review by April 15th, so the planning for release after 9.1 can start. The response was great! 25 individual specifications that have provided the plan review can be viewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/labels/plan%20review&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The work towards the next release is emerging, and I would like to draw your attention towards&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/pull/349&quot;&gt; Jakarta EE Core Profile Creation and Plan Review&lt;/a&gt;. Please review and join the Jakarta EE Platform team meetings to provide your input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Statement direction for Jakarta EE 10 is on its way!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jakarta EE Steering Committee has requested from the Jakarta EE Platform team to formulate a statement of direction for the release 10. You can join the discussion in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/issues/352&quot;&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; , but sharing here main points&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A traditional roadmap with deliverables is still premature, so we need to highlight areas of focus that will build into an eventual roadmap. Areas of focus that need progress before a proper roadmap can be defined include:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addressing lack of specification standalone TCKs that can be composed into new platforms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defining the makeup of the core profile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defining how profile specifications can be released independently and what versioning would look like under this approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promoting individual specification releases&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Address integration of MicroProfile Config as Jakarta Config&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updating core profile specifications to enable build time capable implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handling of optional specification features&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Removing the current circularity between specifications at the TCK level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java SE version and JPMS strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improve architecture guidelines and address specification cohesion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning a little Python using the Eclipse Collections Pet Kata&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p_IjwcPCqU5s3Kk_40n4rQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Eclipse Collections Pet Kata on GitHub (left) : Python implementation of Person class from Pet Kata&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A time to learn Python&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve programmed in more than twenty programming languages over the past four decades. I’ve coded in Java for 20+ years, and am the creator of a Java collections framework called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt;. I have never tried to learn Python before. That is, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why learn Python?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a Java Champion, and regularly teach and advocate for the Java programming language. My learning Python might seem a bit odd to some. In fact, some of my friends started pinging me on Twitter after I posted several tweets about me solving the Pet Kata using Python wondering if I was having a mid-life crisis or if I had been abduckted. I tried to alleviate their concerns with a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheDonRaab/status/1384672543701831681&quot;&gt;@TheDonRaab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is an older programming language than Java, which might surprise some folks. I often recommend to developers to look at older languages to learn new techniques and approaches. I try to practice what I preach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently shared my experience returning to my nostalgic Smalltalk days and implementing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BNYMellon/CodeKatas/tree/master/deck-of-cards-kata&quot;&gt;Deck of Cards Kata&lt;/a&gt; using the Pharo Smalltalk IDE. Programming in Smalltalk using unit tests was a tremendous amount of fun. You can see the results in the following blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/dev-genius/a-little-smalltalk-for-the-soul-b12051b709d1&quot;&gt;A little Smalltalk for the soul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought that I might as well make the most of my recent visit to a dynamic language I knew well and see how quickly I would be able to code productively in Python. Just as I did with Smalltalk, I chose a code kata to implement. This time I went with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/tree/master/pet-kata&quot;&gt;Pet Kata&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve often told folks they can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections Katas&lt;/a&gt; to learn any programming language, as long as there is a way to specify unit tests and implement a domain in the language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made the job of learning Python a lot easier by using the quite capable PyCharm IDE from JetBrains. PyCharm felt very familiar to me, because I have programmed in the IntelliJ IDE from JetBrains for almost twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Domain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start things off, I implemented the domain classes. I knew Python supported object-oriented programming, so I created three classes to represent Person, Pet, and PetType. A Person has zero or more Pets and each Pet has a PetType, which I implemented via an Enum, which is a type both Java and Python support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how I implementedPetType.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/334/1*9_36AvFR0-DJ54MAP5jzVQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;PetType Enum&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how I implemented the Pet class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/651/1*-VH8yT9RU48jub4o8tMWtA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pet Class&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how I implemented the Person class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y_LpbacA7TARAHG4HjZz-Q.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Person class&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can compare the solutions for the domain classes in Python, to the solutions in Java using Eclipse Collections &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/tree/master/pet-kata-solutions/src/main/java/org/eclipse/collections/petkata&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What I learned in the domain classes?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space matters in Python. So do spaces. There are no curly braces like in Java, and Python is less forgiving than Smalltalk in terms of how code is formatted and edited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t define instance variables as you would in Java or Smalltalk, with a special declaration area. The variables come into existence as you define them in the init method. Since Python is dynamic, there is no type to specify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The self keyword is the same name Smalltalk uses for the instance, and is the equivalent of this in Java.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The [] is a literal form of an empty list. You can add things to a list using the append method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You define a function using def, followed by the function name, and a parameter list in parentheses and then ending the definition line with a :. When you define an instance method, the first parameter in every method needs to be self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To implement an Enum, you need to import the Enum type from the enum module or package (not too sure on the terminology here yet). You then have your type extend the Enum type, by putting the Enum type inside the parentheses after the class name, which is PetType in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lambda keyword is used to create a lambda, or anonymous function. The parameters are specified after the keyword, and separated from the expression with a :. I used lambdas with both map and filter functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functions I used in the domain were any, len and map. This is one place where I think Python is missing some object-oriented goodness of encapsulated methods. I think any, len and map should be methods on the list type, not functions that accept an iterable type. Making them methods instead of functions would make them easier to discover. The IDE can help you with code assist if you type . after a type and show you a method list of available methods. This made it harder to discover these functions without using Google with questions like “How do I find the size of a list in python?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Tests in the Kata&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are five separate exercises in the Pet Kata. I decided I would only implement the first four exercises, because that would be enough to get started and develop a feel for what it is like to program in Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to learn how to develop a unit test in Python, so I started Googling for the info. What I discovered is that unit testing in Python is somewhat similar to the unit testing I was familiar with in JUnit 3.x versions. Each test class has to extend unittest.TestCase, and each test method must be prefixed with the word test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assertions are available directly on the instance of the class using the self keyword. So to assert equality, you would use the method self.assertEqual().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;PetDomainForKata&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I started writing the tests, I created the test data I used in the tests. In Java, I put this code in an abstract class, but I had trouble figuring out how to define an instance variable in a parent class and then extending the class and accessing the variable. So instead I decided to just create a function called get_people() which I used in each test case to get the list of people with their pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xGqjlivEP0BaHn88I-ROIg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Test data is a list of people with their pets and ages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can compare the solutions for the test data setup in Python, to the solutions in Java using Eclipse Collections &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/blob/master/pet-kata-solutions/src/test/java/org/eclipse/collections/petkata/PetDomainForKata.java&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Exercise 1 Test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests for exercise 1 in the Pet Kata are fairly straight forward. You need to learn how to transform and filter a list in this exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*t3n5g0GXBjKaaHWEQWxKJg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Transforming and filtering lists using map and filter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this test class, I learned how to use the functions map, filter, list, and len. Both map and filter return iterators which then need to be converted to lists using the list function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can compare the solutions for exercise 1 in Python, to the solutions in Java using Eclipse Collections &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/blob/master/pet-kata-solutions/src/test/java/org/eclipse/collections/petkata/Exercise1Test.java&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Exercise 2 Test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the tests for exercise 2 in the Pet Kata are also fairly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I6FYqUdTAzLr9P6iYSX8qA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Using any, all, sum, list and filter to complete tests in exercise 2&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this test class, I learned how to use the any, all , sum methods in addition to what I learned in exercise 1. I was surprised there was no count function, but I was able to find how to use sum with map and filter to accomplish what was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one test that was not straightforward was the one where I needed to use flatMap. Python does not have a function called flatMap, and instead you need to use a function named chain in a library called itertools along with map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FG6DKQ5UUw4N2JtnYj5oDw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Learning how to flatten a persons pet types using chain and map&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can compare the solutions for exercise 2 in Python, to the solutions in Java using Eclipse Collections &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/blob/master/pet-kata-solutions/src/test/java/org/eclipse/collections/petkata/Exercise2Test.java&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Exercise 3 Test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests in exercise 3 are much harder to complete. This is because they do more complex things like counting and grouping things by other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_M_I-4_sVFRZD0AW_S-STA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Implementing countByEach, groupBy and groupByEach in Python&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to use both the collections.Counter class and itertools.chain function in order to implement the method known in Eclipse Collections as countByEach. The method countByEach is a flatCollect followed by a countBy. In Eclipse Collections, countBy will return a Bag type. I learned that the equivalent type in Python is called Counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a groupBy function in itertools, but it didn’t quite behave as I had hoped. I could not find a simple way to transform the result from groupBy to a dictionary, so I followed the recommended imperative way of using a for loop and converting each group value to a list using the list function. It was interesting to see how to iterate over key and group together in the for loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had to switch to completely imperative approach with nested loops to convert the list of people into a dictionary of pet types mapped to sets of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can compare the solutions for exercise 3 in Python, to the solutions in Java using Eclipse Collections &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/blob/master/pet-kata-solutions/src/test/java/org/eclipse/collections/petkata/Exercise3Test.java&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Exercise 4 Test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After exercises 2 and 3, I was was worried exercise 4 was going to be even more difficult. It turned out to not be so hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*y2KmkF6WuQrj8npo4rw7LA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Calculating the age statistics for Pets with min, max, sum and median&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t find a way to calculate min, max, sum and mean in Python using a single iteration like we do in Java using IntSummaryStatistics, but there are functions for min, max, sum and mean (you need to import the statistics module for mean). I was able to use any and all again, but I could not find an equivalent of none, so used assertFalse with any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zmUJZ9kHk7gbpfLY-Vkxvw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Joining strings, most common, median&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the remaining tests I learned how to use the join method on a string along with map to get a string representation of the names of Bob’s Smiths pets. I then used Counter along with a method named most_common to find the top three pets. Finally, I used the statistics.median function to calculate the median age of the pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can compare the solutions for exercise 4 in Python, to the solutions in Java using Eclipse Collections &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/blob/master/pet-kata-solutions/src/test/java/org/eclipse/collections/petkata/Exercise4Test.java&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned a little bit about Python in this exercise. It was interesting to see how quickly I could get a bunch of tests written in Python up and running. Where I slowed down a bit was in learning whether I needed a function or a method to accomplish something. It was also challenging to understand what the type of something was so I could explore its API in more detail. I was able to leverage the debugger in PyCharm a bit, and it helped in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was comparing and contrasting the Python solutions I came up with along with Java solutions using Eclipse Collections on Twitter. What I discovered along the way was that there were APIs in Eclipse Collections that weren’t used in the solutions that actually made things more concise. I submitted two pull requests to the Eclipse Collections Kata as a result. The additional methods I used to refactor some of the solutions were countByEach, flatCollectInt, and containsBy. These are more advanced “fused” APIs that have evolved over time. You can read more about the evolution of the containsBy “fused” API in the following blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/javarevisited/fusing-methods-for-productivity-c15c9eb2d666&quot;&gt;Fusing methods for productivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this learning experiment implementing the Pet Kata in Python. I definitely feel like I have developed some basic understanding of the Python programming language as a result. And now that I have written this blog, I always have something I can refer back to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a Project Lead and Committer for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; OSS project at the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is open for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;contributions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

	<title>Tom Schindl: Building a cmd-line application to notarize Apple applications using Quarkus and GraalVM Native Image support</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://tomsondev.bestsolution.at/?p=5322</guid>
	<link>https://tomsondev.bestsolution.at/2021/04/23/building-a-cmd-line-application-to-notarize-apple-applications-using-quarkus-and-graalvm-native-image-support/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been searching for a long time for a small side project where I could give &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image&quot;&gt;Quarkus’ Native-Image&lt;/a&gt; support a spin. While we are using Quarkus in JDK mode in almost all of our server applications there was no need yet to compile a native binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week although I found the perfect usecase: I’ve been banging my head against codesigning and notarizing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomsondev.bestsolution.at/feed/efxclipse.org/&quot;&gt;e(fx)clipse application&lt;/a&gt; (shipped with a JRE) the whole week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing that requires to execute a bunch of cmd-utilities one by one. So I came up with the plan to write an Quarkus command line application, compiled to a native executable to automate this process a bit more. Yeah there are go and python solutions and I could have simply written a shell-script but why not try something cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of this work is a native OS-X executable allowing me to codesign, create a dmg/pkg, notarize and finally staple the result as you can see from the screenshot below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;115746928-0f796280-a395-11eb-9ec8-abe9fd94d591&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5334&quot; height=&quot;1470&quot; src=&quot;https://tomsondev.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/115746928-0f796280-a395-11eb-9ec8-abe9fd94d591.png&quot; width=&quot;3382&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As of now this does not include anything special for Java application so it can be used for any application (I currently have an artifical restriction that you can only use &lt;em&gt;.app&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All sources are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BestSolution-at/mac-codesigner&quot;&gt;https://github.com/BestSolution-at/mac-codesigner&lt;/a&gt; and I added a pre-release of the native executable. Miss a feature, found a bug? Feel free to file a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BestSolution-at/mac-codesigner/issues&quot;&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt; and provide a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BestSolution-at/mac-codesigner/pulls&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/styles/static/images/logo/logo_bigger.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After shipping the OSGi Core Release 8 in December, the OSGi Working Group (WG) is now incubating at the Eclipse Foundation. The OSGi WG (previously named “OSGi Alliance”) announced the move to Eclipse last October. It has already ratified the charter, created two committees and two working groups, and migrated its code repositories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;i&gt;By Karsten Silz&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Red Hat CodeReady Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview/&quot;&gt;Red Hat CodeReady product page&lt;/a&gt; and run it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;java -jar codereadystudio-&amp;lt;installername&amp;gt;.jar&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) CodeReady Studio require a bit more:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This release requires at least Eclipse 4.19 (2021-03) but we recommend
      using the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2021-03/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers&quot;&gt;Eclipse 4.19 2021-03 JEE Bundle&lt;/a&gt;
      since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock warning&quot;&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;

      &lt;i class=&quot;fa icon-warning&quot; title=&quot;Warning&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Java11 is now required to run Red Hat Developer Studio or JBoss Tools (this is a requirement from Eclipse 4.17). So make sure to select a Java11 JDK in the installer.
      You can still work with pre-Java11 JDK/JRE and projects in the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on the Eclipse Marketplace under &quot;JBoss Tools&quot; or &quot;Red Hat CodeReady Studio&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For JBoss Tools, you can also use our update site directly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our main focus for this release was an improved tooling for the Quarkus framework, improvements for container based development and bug fixing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Red Hat provides an online OpenShift environment called
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://red.ht/dev-sandbox&quot;&gt;Developer Sandbox&lt;/a&gt; that makes it easy for developers to build, test and deploy cloud
      native applications and microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In order to use Developer Sandbox, you must own a Red Hat SSO account (which can be linked to social accounts like
      GitHub,…​). Once logged in into Red Hat SSO, you will get an environment provisioned in Developer Sandbox but
      the first time you will try to login in to Developer Sandbox, your account needs to be verified (in order to
      prevent crypto miners and robots) thus you need to go through a verification phase where you will be asked to provide:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;first your phone number and country code&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;then a verification code that you will receive on your smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So it is now possible to provision and log in to Developer Sandbox from the OpenShift tooling and connect it to the Developer Sandbox environment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;code&gt;OpenShift Application Explorer&lt;/code&gt; view (&lt;code&gt;Window → Show View → Other…​&lt;/code&gt;, enter &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; and double click on &lt;code&gt;OpenShift Application Explorer&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;devsandbox1&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/devsandbox1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Right click on the first node and select the &lt;code&gt;Login&lt;/code&gt; context menu:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;devsandbox2&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/devsandbox2.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In order to provision the Developer Sandbox environment, click on the &lt;code&gt;Red Hat Developer Sandbox&lt;/code&gt; link: a browser window will open and you will be required to login to your Red Hat SSO account:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Login to your account (please note that if you don’t have a Red Hat account, you can create a new one). Once
      you’re logged in, you should see the following window:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;devsandbox4&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/devsandbox4.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Enter your contry code (+XX) and phone number and click the &lt;code&gt;Verify&lt;/code&gt; button:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You will be required to provide the verification code that you should have received on your phone:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Once your Developer Sandbox environment is provisioned; you will see the following window:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;code&gt;DevSandbox&lt;/code&gt; link and log in with the same credentials: you will see the following window:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When it comes to login to a cluster, OpenShift Tools supported two different authentication mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;user/password&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;token&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The drawback is that it does not cover clusters where a more enhanced and modern authentication infrastructure is in place. So it is now possible to login to the cluster through an embedded web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In order to use it, go to the Login context menu from the Application Explorer view:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;weblogin1&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/weblogin1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;code&gt;Retrieve token&lt;/code&gt; button and an embedded web browser will be displayed:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;weblogin2&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/weblogin2.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Complete the workflow until you see a page that contains &lt;code&gt;Display Token&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;weblogin3&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/weblogin3.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;code&gt;Display Token&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The web browser is automatically closed and you’ll notice that the retrieved token has been set in the original dialog:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since JBoss Tools 4.18.0.Final, the preferred way of developing components is now based on devfile, which is a YAML file that describe how to build the component and if required, launch other containers with other containers.
      When you create a component, you need to specify a devfile that describe your component. So either you component source contains its own devfile or you need to pick a devfile that is related to your component.
      In the second case, OpenShift Tools supports devfile registries that contains a set of different devfiles. There is a default registry (&lt;a class=&quot;bare&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/odo-devfiles/registry&quot;&gt;https://github.com/odo-devfiles/registry&lt;/a&gt;) but you may want to have your own registries. It is now possible to add and remove registries as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The registries are displayed in the OpenShift Application Explorer under the &lt;code&gt;Devfile registries&lt;/code&gt; node:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;registries1&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/registries1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Please note that expanding the registry node will list all devfiles from that registry with a description:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;registries2&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/registries2.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A context menu on the &lt;code&gt;Devfile registries&lt;/code&gt; node allows you to add new registries, and on the registry node to delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although devfile registries can provide ready-to-use devfiles, there may be some advanced cases where users need to write their own devfile. As the syntax is quite complex, the YAML editor has been completed so that to provide:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;syntax validation&lt;/p&gt;

Also, removing this association was not easy for the end user. The user can still assign a editor to a certain file type via the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;menuseq&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;Open With&lt;/span&gt; ▸ &lt;span class=&quot;menuitem&quot;&gt;Other…​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some types of launch-configurations start operating-system processes when launched from Eclipse. When you terminate the corresponding process before it completes (for example by clicking the &lt;strong&gt;terminate&lt;/strong&gt; button, the red square) that operating-system process is destroyed. Now the descendants of that process, its child-processes created by the main-process and their children recursively, are destroyed too.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect4&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h5 id=&quot;termination-of-child-processes-of-launched-os-processes-can-be-configured&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#termination-of-child-processes-of-launched-os-processes-can-be-configured&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Termination of child processes of launched OS processes can be configured&lt;/h5&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since Eclipse 4.18 child processes (descendants) of an operating system process launched from Eclipse are terminated too, when the launched process is terminated (for example by clicking the terminate button).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is now possible to configure in the Launch Configuration whether the child processes of a launched process should be terminated too or if they should stay alive, in case the launched processes is terminated. You can control this with the checkbox &lt;strong&gt;Terminate child processes if terminating the launched process&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Common&lt;/strong&gt; tab of the &lt;strong&gt;Run/Debug Configurations&lt;/strong&gt; dialog. By default this checkbox is selected and child processes are terminated too.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

In the case where the existing code catches or throws an exception that sub-classes the exceptions of the new &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; clause, an additional &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt;  clause will be added to rethrow the exception to ensure code logic remains consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The created type will declare the &lt;code&gt;sealed&lt;/code&gt; type as its super type and it can be declared as final, non-sealed, or sealed with the available quick fixes for further inheritance control.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new tab named &lt;strong&gt;Java Feature&lt;/strong&gt; has been added to the &lt;strong&gt;Clean Up&lt;/strong&gt; preferences. It lists the clean up options that introduce the use of language features from different Java versions. Relevant clean up options from other tabs have also been moved to this new tab.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that uses pattern matching for the &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; operator when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that removes useless indentation when the opposite workflow falls through.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When several blocks fall through, it reduces the block with the greatest indentation. It can negate an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; condition if the else statements fall through.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that moves increment or decrement outside an expression.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A prefix increment/decrement (&lt;code&gt;i`) first changes the value of the variable and then returns the updated value. A postfix increment/decrement (`i&lt;/code&gt;) first returns the original value and then changes the value of the variable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But let’s look at this code:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;int i = j++;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most of the developers hardly remember which from the increment or the assignment comes first. One way to make the code obvious is to write the increment/decrement in a dedicated statement:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;int i = j;
      j++;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And so for the prefix expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;int i = ++j;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…​it goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;j++;
      int i = j;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The cleanup moves a prefix expression above the statement and a postfix expression below. It does not move increments from loop condition and it does not cleanup several increments in the same statement. The increment/decrement is always rewritten as a postfix expression for standardization.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To apply the clean up, select &lt;strong&gt;Extract increment/decrement from statement&lt;/strong&gt; check box on the &lt;strong&gt;Code Style&lt;/strong&gt; tab in your clean up profile.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that replaces a plain comparator instance by a lambda expression passed to a &lt;code&gt;Comparator.comparing()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Comparator&lt;/code&gt; type must be inferred by the destination of the comparator. The algorithm of the comparator must be standard and based on one field or method. The cleanup can handle the null values and reversed orders.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To apply the clean up, select &lt;strong&gt;Use Comparator.comparing()&lt;/strong&gt; check box on the &lt;strong&gt;Java Feature&lt;/strong&gt; tab in your clean up profile.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that avoids to create primitive wrapper when parsing a string.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The object should be used as a primitive and not as a wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that extracts common code from the end of an &lt;code&gt;if / else if / else&lt;/code&gt; control flow.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ultimately it removes the empty and passive &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The control flow should have an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; clause and the duplicate code should not rely on variables declared in the block.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The statement matching performs a deep analysis. All the blocks should end with the same set of statements, or the blocks with different code should fall through with a jump statement (&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that removes the second &lt;code&gt;substring()&lt;/code&gt; parameter if this parameter is the length of the string. It’s the default value.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It must reference the same expression.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that detects two &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; conditions that are identical and removes the second one.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The conditions should be passive.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t create unreachable code below the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement which would create a compile error. That is to say it avoids the case where only the removed block doesn’t fall through, all the other cases fall through, there are an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; clause (not only &lt;code&gt;if/else&lt;/code&gt; clauses) and a statement after the control workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A new tab named &lt;strong&gt;Source Fixing&lt;/strong&gt; has been added to the &lt;strong&gt;Clean Up&lt;/strong&gt; preferences. It lists the clean up options that fixes the behavior of the code. The &lt;strong&gt;Compare with != 0 for bitwise expression&lt;/strong&gt; clean up option from &lt;strong&gt;Code style&lt;/strong&gt; tab have also been moved to this new tab.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock warning&quot;&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Use it carefully. You may get an unexpected behavior. It may trigger zombie code. A zombie code is a dead code that is dead because an error occurs before. The day someone fixes the error, the zombie code comes back to life and alters the behavior. Although most of the cleanups need review, those ones need testing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that inverts calls to &lt;code&gt;Object.equals(Object)&lt;/code&gt;  and &lt;code&gt;String.equalsIgnoreCase(String)&lt;/code&gt; to avoid useless null pointer exception.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The caller must be nullable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The parameter must not be nullable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The code is not supposed to predict the &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; values; it is supposed to get zero or a value lesser or greater than zero.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Java Editor&lt;/strong&gt; now uses Completion overwrites as the default. If Completion overwrites is on, the completion text replaces the characters following the caret position until the end of the word. If Completion inserts is on, the completion text is inserted at the caret position, so it never overwrites any existing text. Note that pressing Ctrl when applying a completion proposal toggles between the two insertion modes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can change the default in the &lt;strong&gt;Java &amp;gt; Editor &amp;gt; Content Assist&lt;/strong&gt; preference page.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Instead of simply inserting the method parameter names as placeholders, when a method is completed, the &lt;strong&gt;Java Editor&lt;/strong&gt; now inserts the best guessed parameters by default.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can change the default in the &lt;strong&gt;Java &amp;gt; Editor &amp;gt; Content Assist&lt;/strong&gt; preference page.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new quick assist and clean up has been added that converts switch statements to switch expressions (Java 14 or higher) where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Switch statements that use control statements such as nested switch statements, if/else blocks, for/while loops are not considered as is the case for return/continue statements. All cases of the switch statement must either have a last assignment statement that sets the same variable/field as other cases, or else has a &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statement. Fall-through is allowed between cases but only if there are no other statements in between. The switch statement must have a &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; case unless the switch expression is an enum type and all possible enum values are represented in the cases.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To apply the quick assist, press &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl+1&lt;/strong&gt; on the target switch statement and select &lt;strong&gt;Convert to switch expression&lt;/strong&gt;, if offered.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To apply the clean up, invoke &lt;strong&gt;Source &amp;gt; Clean Up…​&lt;/strong&gt;, use a custom profile, and on the &lt;strong&gt;Configure…​&lt;/strong&gt; dialog, select &lt;strong&gt;Convert to switch expression&lt;/strong&gt; check box on the &lt;strong&gt;Code Style&lt;/strong&gt; tab (or the &lt;strong&gt;Java Feature&lt;/strong&gt; tab starting from Eclipse 2021-03).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that replaces the &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator with &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; when the comparison expression has a bitwise expression operand and a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; operand.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This resolves an anti-pattern for such kind of comparisons, which can also be a bug when the bitwise expression is involving a negative constant value. This code smell is further described by the FindBugs project as bug description &quot;BIT: Check for sign of bitwise operation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that replaces &lt;code&gt;if/else if/else&lt;/code&gt; blocks to use &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It converts to &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; when there are more than two cases.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It does not convert if the discriminant can be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, that is to say only primitive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It does a variable conflict analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The case value can be literals or constants.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To apply the clean up, invoke &lt;strong&gt;Source &amp;gt; Clean Up…​&lt;/strong&gt;, use a custom profile, and on the &lt;strong&gt;Configure…​&lt;/strong&gt; dialog, select &lt;strong&gt;Convert if/else if/else chain to switch&lt;/strong&gt; check box on the &lt;strong&gt;Code Style&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that uses &lt;code&gt;Collection.addAll()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Collections.addAll()&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It refactors &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops with index, &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops with iterator and &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loops.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the source is an array, the list is raw, and the Java version is 1.5 or higher, we use &lt;code&gt;Arrays.asList()&lt;/code&gt; to handle the erasure type. It doesn’t decrease the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It detects similar statements. It also checks that the declarations of the variables in the statements are the same.

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The condition must be passive. The removed code should not throw an expected exception. The cleanup uses a deep condition comparison algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that rewrites Eclipse-autogenerated &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method by Eclipse-autogenerated &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; method for Java 7 using &lt;code&gt;Objects.hash()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Let’s remind that you can autogenerate your &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; methods by right-clicking on your class, selecting &lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt; and clicking on &lt;strong&gt;Generate hashCode() and equals() methods…​.&lt;/strong&gt; Since Eclipse 2018-09, a checkbox allows you to generate your methods using Java 7 API. This cleanup rewrites your method as if it has been generated using this option.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This clean up does not generate again your method from scratch, it rewrites it using a more modern syntax. That is to say, if your method is missing or voluntary does not process a field, this field still won’t be processed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To apply the clean up, invoke &lt;strong&gt;Source &amp;gt; Clean Up…​&lt;/strong&gt;, use a custom profile, and on the &lt;strong&gt;Configure…​&lt;/strong&gt; dialog, select &lt;strong&gt;Use Objects.hash()&lt;/strong&gt; check box on the &lt;strong&gt;Unnecessary Code&lt;/strong&gt; tab (or the &lt;strong&gt;Java Feature&lt;/strong&gt; tab starting from Eclipse 2021-03).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that reduces double negation in &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; expression.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It removes negations on both operands in an equality/difference operation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Removes useless bad value checks before assignments or &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statements. Such useless bad value checks are comparing an expression against bad value, then either assigning bad value or the expression depending on the result of the bad value check. It is simpler to directly assign the expression.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The expression should be passive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The excluded value should be hard coded.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statement at the end of a loop is removed. A &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statement at the end of a control statement is removed if the control statement is at the end of a loop. A &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statement is kept if it has a label.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that changes code to make use of Java 7 try-with-resources feature. In particular, it removes now useless &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It may move an inner closeable assignment as a resource. It handles &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; with a simple &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt; invocation, a null-check and remaining statements below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is only enabled from Java 7 and it also handles the Java 9 syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To apply the clean up, invoke &lt;strong&gt;Source &amp;gt; Clean Up…​&lt;/strong&gt;, use a custom profile, and on the &lt;strong&gt;Configure…​&lt;/strong&gt; dialog, select &lt;strong&gt;Use try-with-resource&lt;/strong&gt; check box on the &lt;strong&gt;Unnecessary Code&lt;/strong&gt; tab (or the &lt;strong&gt;Java Feature&lt;/strong&gt; tab starting from Eclipse 2021-03).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that adds a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; to avoid passive &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The inner assignments must not do other different assignments after (assign other values or assign into other variables).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There must be no side effects after the first assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that replaces &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; concatenation by &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It uses StringBuffer for Java 1.4-.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It only replaces strings on several statements and the concatenation should have more than two pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The variable should be only concatenated and it should retrieve the string once.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To apply the clean up, invoke &lt;strong&gt;Source &amp;gt; Clean Up…​&lt;/strong&gt;, use a custom profile, and on the &lt;strong&gt;Configure…​&lt;/strong&gt; dialog, select &lt;strong&gt;Replace String concatenation by StringBuilder&lt;/strong&gt; check box on the &lt;strong&gt;Optimization&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that replaces a primitive boxing to serialize by a call to the static &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It works for all the primitive types: &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A new clean up has been added that replaces &lt;code&gt;Boolean.TRUE&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Boolean.FALSE&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; when used as primitive.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A new preference option has been added and enabled by default: &lt;strong&gt;Preferences &amp;gt; Java &amp;gt; Enable parallel index search&lt;/strong&gt;. Depending on the available hardware, this option should improve performance for all index based Java search operations, but could also lead to possible regressions.

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new option named &lt;strong&gt;Restricted identifiers&lt;/strong&gt; has been added under Java category in &lt;strong&gt;Java &amp;gt; Editor &amp;gt; Syntax Coloring&lt;/strong&gt; preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some identifiers (e.g. var, yield, record etc.) are restricted identifiers because they are not allowed in some contexts. Semantic highlighting options for such identifiers can be controlled by the element &lt;strong&gt;Restricted identifiers&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt; category in &lt;strong&gt;Java &amp;gt; Editor &amp;gt; Syntax Coloring&lt;/strong&gt; preference page.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The concept of external null annotations has been extended to apply to source folders, too.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;External annotations were introduced in Eclipse 4.5 in order to overlay not-editable library classes with null annotations to specify the null contract against which library calls should be analysed. You can now apply the same concept for another kind of classes that should not be edited: generated source code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Java Build Path&lt;/strong&gt; dialog, also source folders now have a node &lt;strong&gt;External annotations&lt;/strong&gt; where a path to Eclipse External Annotation files (.eea) can be configured.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;annotate sources config&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.19/images/annotate-sources-config.png&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given a project that is configured for annotation based null analysis, and given a Java class inside a source folder configured for external annotations, the editor now offers a quick assist (&lt;strong&gt;Ctrl+1&lt;/strong&gt;) for annotating individual type references in the signatures of methods and fields.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;annotate sources assist&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.19/images/annotate-sources-assist.png&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The selected option will record that the return type should be interpreted as &lt;code&gt;@NonNull List&amp;lt;Attribute&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (the popup to the right showing the internal format how this annotation will be stored in an .eea file). With this annotation in place, the annotated signature will be shown in hovers and will be used for null analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;annotate sources effect&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.19/images/annotate-sources-effect.png&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Imports for static &lt;code&gt;org.mockito.Mockito.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are added to the Java favorites in the preferences under *Java &amp;gt; Editor &amp;gt; Content Assists &amp;gt; Favorites&lt;/code&gt;. This way the organize imports action in the IDE will automatically add static imports to this class when you use the Mockito library in your tests.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can perform a fine-grained search for permitted type declarations in the &lt;strong&gt;Search dialog (Ctrl+H) &amp;gt; Java Search &amp;gt; Limit To &amp;gt; Match Locations&lt;/strong&gt; with the new option:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Preferences &amp;gt; Java &amp;gt; Appearance &amp;gt; [x] Sort library entries alphabetically in Package Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; is now enabled by default. This makes it easier for you to see if a library is available or not.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you want to see the order in which the libraries are added to the classpath, e.g. to understand classpath loading issues, you can disable the preference.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new &lt;strong&gt;Toggle Tracepoint&lt;/strong&gt; context-menu entry has been added to the &lt;strong&gt;Java Editor&lt;/strong&gt; line ruler. Both the &lt;strong&gt;Toggle Tracepoint&lt;/strong&gt; options i.e. the new context-menu entry and the existing option under &lt;strong&gt;Run&lt;/strong&gt; menu have a new icon and are now available for Java class files also along with Java source files.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A new check box was added to the &lt;strong&gt;Arguments&lt;/strong&gt; tab for Java based launch configurations (Java Application, JUnit, and others) for writing arguments into an @argfile. This is disabled below Java 9 and can be enabled for Java programs launched with Java 9 and above.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Debug&lt;/strong&gt; view no longer breaks when logical structures are shown while the application’s garbage collector is active (&lt;code&gt;com.sun.jdi.ObjectCollectedException&lt;/code&gt; occurred while retrieving value).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h5 id=&quot;annotations-wrapping&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#annotations-wrapping&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Annotations wrapping&lt;/h5&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The formatter now allows more control over &lt;strong&gt;how multiple annotations on a single element should be divided into lines&lt;/strong&gt;. Previously, they could either all be placed in a single line along with the annotated element, or each in a separate line. The settings that controlled this behavior (in the &lt;strong&gt;New Lines &amp;gt; After annotations&lt;/strong&gt; section) now only control a line break between the last annotation and the annotated element. Line breaks between annotations are controlled by a new group of settings in the &lt;strong&gt;Line Wrapping &amp;gt; Wrapping Settings &amp;gt; Annotations&lt;/strong&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Just like with standard wrapping settings, they can be set to keep everything in a single line (&lt;strong&gt;Do not wrap&lt;/strong&gt;), each annotation in a separate line (&lt;strong&gt;Wrap all elements&lt;/strong&gt;), or only break lines that exceed the width limit (&lt;strong&gt;Wrap where necessary&lt;/strong&gt;). The last option along with the &lt;strong&gt;Never join already wrapped lines&lt;/strong&gt; setting effectively means manual control over each case. The annotation wrapping settings differ from other wrapping settings in that the indentation control is not available.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The formatter configuration sections can be found in the &lt;strong&gt;Profile Editor (Preferences &amp;gt; Java &amp;gt; Code Style &amp;gt; Formatter &amp;gt; Edit…​&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

It can be used to evaluate the capabilities of Eclipse Theia on the desktop as well as to serve as a “blueprint” upon which to build a custom product based on Eclipse Theia. It has recently been contributed to the Eclipse Theia open source project and is based on work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thegecko&quot;&gt;Rob Moran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html&quot;&gt;STMicroelectronics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/&quot;&gt;EclipseSource&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Theia is a framework for creating web-based tools and IDEs. Consider it a more open and flexible alternative to VS Code. Eclipse Theia shares quite a number of core concepts with VS Code (including the language server protocol and the UX design), and it reuses certain open VS Code components, such as the code editor.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
There are also some clear differentiators between Eclipse Theia and VS Code. Eclipse Theia is a flexible base upon which to build any kind of domain-specific tool. This includes IDEs, but is not limited to this use case. (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2019/12/06/the-eclipse-theia-ide-vs-vs-code/&quot;&gt;this comparison between Theia and VS Code&lt;/a&gt; for additional information on this topic). Products built on Eclipse Theia can be deployed in the cloud as browser applications, but also as desktop applications via Electron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that Eclipse Theia is not a product in and of itself, Rather, it is a platform upon which products can be built. A good way to experience Eclipse Theia  is to use one of the products or projects that have already adopted it in their own product offerings. This list includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/emfcloud/#coffeeeditoroverview&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coffee editor example&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;: An open source example for a domain-specific development environment based on Eclipse Theia, including an online demonstration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;&quot;&gt;… and a growing list of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ecdtools.eclipse.org/adopters/&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;other products adopting Theia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can always &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2019/09/25/how-to-launch-eclipse-theia/&quot;&gt;build and start Eclipse Theia yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
While there are several ways to “use“ Eclipse Theia, one of the most commonly requested features for a long time has been a downloadable desktop version. This makes sense from a user and adopter point of view, especially if you want the vanilla Eclipse Theia. Furthermore, a template product based on Theia would be a nice starting point for building any custom product. This is exactly what Eclipse Theia Blueprint provides!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eclipse Theia Blueprint is a downloadable, installable template tool for evaluating Theia capabilities on the desktop and to serve as a basis for building custom products&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/system/files/blogs/Screenshot%202021-04-09%20at%2016.43.34.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Eclipse Theia Blueprint Application Window&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.eclipse.org/system/files/blogs/Screenshot%202021-04-09%20at%2016.43.34.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theia Blueprint Application Window &lt;/strong&gt;(click image to open full-size in new window)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theia Blueprint assembles a selection of Eclipse Theia extensions (i.e. features), including a selection of most commonly used VS Code extensions from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://open-vsx.org/&quot;&gt;Open VSX Registry&lt;/a&gt;. It provides everything as a desktop application, along with installers for the various operating systems. Theia Blueprint essentially bundles things that are already there and makes them easier to consume. All build scripts of Theia Blueprint are part of the open source project, as well as documentation on how to customize them to your own needs. Theia Blueprint is a good foundation upon which to define and build your own desktop tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Theia Blueprint offers many advantages to developers, it is also important to state what Theia Blueprint is not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eclipse Theia Blueprint is not a fully polished and tested IDE product meant to replace VS Code, the Eclipse IDE or any other existing production IDEs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important to keep in mind in terms of expectations. At the moment, there is no dedicated product team to ensure the quality of the installable product. Theia Blueprint simply  bundles the latest release of various components. While the quality of these underlying components is good, some of them may not be as polished as commercially driven alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This said,  with significant community interest and participation in driving Theia Blueprint forward, turning this into a more production-ready IDE is certainly within reach. Initially, the most important contributions include bug reporting bugs and feature requests, e.g. about components to be included in the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Theia Blueprint is now available as an Alpha version and can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://theia-ide.org/docs/blueprint_download&quot;&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to use it as a template for building your own product, please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theia-ide.org/docs/blueprint_documentation/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-blueprint&quot;&gt;sources on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a detailed understanding of what Theia Blueprint product currently consists of, please see the About dialog in the application. Essentially, a set of most commonly used components were selected, including language support for TypeScript, Java and some common file types such as CSS, MarkDown or Yaml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Theia Blueprint features are based on Theia and the included extensions/plugins. For bugs in Theia please consider opening an issue in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/new/choose&quot;&gt;Theia project on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Theia Blueprint only packages existing functionality and provides an installable version. If you believe there is a mistake in packaging, something needs to be added to the packaging or the installers do not work properly, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-example/issues/new/choose&quot;&gt;open an issue on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you find Theia Blueprint to be useful and agree with us that it fills an important gap by making it much simpler to evaluate Eclipse Theia on the desktop, while also being a template upon which to build new desktop products. Please keep in mind that Eclipse Theia-based products can also be deployed in the cloud and accessed via a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Thabang Mashologu: Three Good Reasons to Complete the Jakarta EE Developer Survey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">6964 at https://blogs.eclipse.org</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/thabang-mashologu/three-good-reasons-complete-jakarta-ee-developer-survey</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys often seem to come around when we’re busiest and feel we can’t afford to take time to answer questions. However, a few minutes of your time can have important benefits down the road to everyone in the Java ecosystem. Now in its fourth year, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/F97CTD2&quot;&gt;Jakarta EE Developer Survey&lt;/a&gt; is open until &lt;strong&gt;May 31&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, more than 2,200 software developers, architects, and decision-makers around the world responded to the survey, an increase of almost 20 percent over the previous year. Here are three reasons everyone in the Java community should take a few minutes to provide their input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Discover the Latest Trends in Tools and Technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sharing details about the Java framework, JDK, runtime, IDE, and perhaps other languages you’re using to build cloud native applications, you can help paint a more accurate picture of which technologies and tools are gaining ground, and which are losing favor.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Understanding these trends may lead you to explore the benefits of other frameworks, runtimes, and tools that deliver capabilities you don’t have today and can help accelerate your cloud evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Gain Insight Into Architectural Approaches and Cloud Evolution Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, there’s been quite a bit of discussion about the benefits of various strategies to implement Java systems in the cloud. Interestingly, last year’s Jakarta EE Developer Survey revealed that the use of monolithic architectures jumped from 13 percent in 2019 to 25 percent in 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
With input about your architectural approach and timeline for evolving Java systems to the cloud, everyone in the Java ecosystem will have better visibility into ongoing strategies to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Lift and shift” legacy applications to the cloud&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Re-architect legacy applications as microservices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Create new cloud native applications from the ground up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This visibility could very well influence your cloud evolution strategy and approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Influence Jakarta EE Priorities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jakarta EE Developer Survey is a great opportunity to indicate how you would like Jakarta EE to evolve to meet your cloud requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Maybe there are certain features and functions you need Jakarta EE specifications to provide. Maybe you’re looking for better support for microservices or tighter integration with container orchestration technologies. Perhaps you’re looking for a faster pace of innovation. Or, perhaps you’re looking for something else altogether.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Whatever your priorities are, the Jakarta EE community needs to know so they can make informed decisions that are aligned as closely as possible with the priorities of developers globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start the Survey Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The more people who take a few minutes to complete the survey, the more accurate the results will be. Make sure your point of view is included.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Stephan Herrmann: Retrospective of an Old Man</title>

	<description>&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last summer I dropped my pen concerning contributions for Eclipse JDT. I never made a public announcement about this, but half a year later I started to think: doesn’t it look weird to receive a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/eclipseawards/winners_lifetime.php&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lifetime Achievement Award&lt;/a&gt; and then run off without even saying thanks for all the fish? Shouldn’t I at least try to explain what happened? I soon realized that writing a final post to balance accounts with Eclipse would neither be easy nor desirable. Hence the idea, to step back more than a couple of steps, and put my observations on the table in smaller chunks. Hopefully this will allow me to describe things calmly, perhaps there’s even an interesting conclusion to be drawn, but I’ll try to leave that to readers as much as I can.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While I’m not yet preparing for retirement, let me illustrate the &lt;strong&gt;long road&lt;/strong&gt; that led me where I am today: I have always had a strong interest in &lt;strong&gt;software tools&lt;/strong&gt;, and while still in academia (during the 1990s) my first significant development task was providing a specialized development environment (for a “hybrid specification language” if you will). That environment was based on what I felt to be modern at that time: &lt;strong&gt;XEmacs&lt;/strong&gt; (remember: “&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;macs &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;akes &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;omputer &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;low”, the root cause being: “&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;ight &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;egabytes &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;nd &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;ontinuously &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;wapping”). I vaguely remember a little time later I was adventurous and installed an early version of NetBeans. Even though the memory of my machine was upped (was it already 128 MB?), that encounter is remembered as surpassing the bad experience of Emacs. I never got anything done with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A central part of my academic activity was in programming language development in the wider area of &lt;a href=&quot;http://modularity.info/conference/2002/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aspect Oriented Software Development&lt;/a&gt;. For pragmatical reasons (and against relevant advice by Gilad Bracha) I chose Java as the base language to be extended to become ObjectTeams/Java, later rebranded as OT/J. I owe much to two students, whose final projects (“Diplomarbeit”) was devoted to two successive iterations of the &lt;strong&gt;OT/J compiler&lt;/strong&gt;. One student modified javac version 1.3 (the implementation by Martin Odersky, adopted by Sun just shortly before). It was this student who first mentioned Eclipse to me, and in fact he was using Eclipse for his work. I still have a scribbled note from July 2002 “I finally installed Eclipse” – what would have been some version 2.0.x. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for moving forward after the javac-based compiler was: &lt;strong&gt;licensing&lt;/strong&gt;. Once it dawned on me, that Eclipse contains an open-source Java compiler with no legal restrictions regarding our modifications, I started to dream about more, not just a compiler but an entire IDE for Object Teams! As a first step, another student was assigned the task to “port” our compiler modifications from javac to ecj. Some joint debugging sessions (late in 2002?) with him where my first encounters with the code base of Eclipse JDT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;First Encounters with Eclipse&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a long period Eclipse to me was (a) a development environment I was eager to learn, and (b) a huge code base in CVS to slowly wrap our heads around and coerce into what we wanted it to be. Surely, we were overwhelmed at first, but once we had funding for our project, a nice little crowd of researchers and students, we gradually munched our way through the big pile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was quite excited, when in 2004 I spotted a bug in the compiler, reported it in bugzilla (only to learn, that it had already been fixed &lt;img alt=&quot;ðŸ™‚&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt; ). It took two more years until the first relevant encounter: I had spotted &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/140643&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another compiler bug&lt;/a&gt;, which was then tagged as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?classification=Eclipse%20Project&amp;amp;component=Core&amp;amp;keywords=greatbug%2C%20&amp;amp;keywords_type=allwords&amp;amp;list_id=20516679&amp;amp;product=JDT&amp;amp;query_format=advanced&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greatbug&lt;/a&gt;. This earned me my first Eclipse T-shirt (“&lt;em&gt;I helped make Callisto a better place&lt;/em&gt;“). It’s quite washed out, but I still highly value it (and I know exactly one more person owning the same T-shirt, hi Ed &lt;img alt=&quot;ðŸ™‚&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after, I met some of my role models in person: at &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.imt-atlantique.fr/x-info/ecoop2006/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ECOOP 2006 in Nantes&lt;/a&gt;, the Eclipse foundation held a special workshop called “&lt;strong&gt;eTX – Eclipse Technology Exchange&lt;/strong&gt;“, which actually was a superb opportunity for people from academia to connect with folks at Eclipse. I specifically recall inspiring chats with &lt;strong&gt;Jerome Lanneluc&lt;/strong&gt; (an author of JDT’s Java Model) and &lt;strong&gt;Martin Aeschlimann&lt;/strong&gt; (JDT/UI). That’s when I learned how &lt;em&gt;welcoming&lt;/em&gt; the Eclipse community is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the following years, I attended my first Eclipse summits / conferences and such. IIRC I met &lt;strong&gt;Philippe Mulet&lt;/strong&gt; twice. I admired him immensely. Not only was he lead developer of JDT/Core, responsible for building much of the great stuff in the first place. Also he had just gone through the exercise of moving JDT from Java 1.4 to Java 5, a task that cannot be overestimated. Having spoken to Philippe is one of the reasons why I consider myself a member of a second generation at Eclipse: a generation that still connects to the initial era, though not having been part of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;End of an Era&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For me, no other person represents the initial era of Eclipse as much as &lt;strong&gt;Dani&lt;/strong&gt; did. That era has come to an end (&lt;em&gt;silence&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still a few people from the first generation are around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/strong&gt; is as firm as a rock in maintaining Equinox, with no sign of fatigue. I think he really is up for an award.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olivier Thomann&lt;/strong&gt; (first commit 2002) still responsibly handles issues in a few weird areas of JDT (notably: computation of StackMaps, and unicode handling).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Arthorne&lt;/strong&gt; has been seen occasionally. He was the one who long, long time ago explained to me the joke behind package org.eclipse.core.internal.watson (it’s elementary).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;What was it like to join the community?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t before 2010 that I became a committer for JDT/Core. I was the first committer for JDT who was not paid by IBM. I was immensely flattered by the offer. So getting into the inner circle &lt;strong&gt;took time&lt;/strong&gt;: 6 years from first bug report until committer status, while all the time I was more or less actively hacking on our fork of JDT. This is to say: I was engaged with the code all the time. Did I expect things to move faster? No.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after getting committer status, for several years mutual &lt;strong&gt;reviews&lt;/strong&gt; of patches among the team were the norm. The leads (first Olivier, then Srikanth) were quite strict in this. Admittedly, I had to get used to that – my patches waiting for reviews, my own development time split between the “real work” and “boring” reviews. In retrospect the &lt;strong&gt;safety net &lt;/strong&gt;of peer reviews was a life saver – plus of course a great opportunity to improve my coding and communication skills. Let me emphasize: this was one committer reviewing the patches of another committer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had much &lt;strong&gt;respect for the code base&lt;/strong&gt; I worked with. While working in academia, I had never seen such a big and complex code base before. And yet, there was no part that could not be learned, as all the code showed a clear and principled design. I don’t know how big the impact of Eric Gamma on details of the code was, but clearly the code spoke with the same clarity as the GoF book on design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As such, I soon learned a fundamental principle for newcomers: “&lt;strong&gt;Monkey see, monkey do&lt;/strong&gt;“. I &lt;em&gt;appreciated&lt;/em&gt; this principle because it held the promise that my own code might share the same high quality as the examples I found out there. In later days, I heard a similar attitude framed as “&lt;strong&gt;When in Rome, do as Romans do&lt;/strong&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My perspective on JDT has always been determined by entering through the &lt;strong&gt;compiler&lt;/strong&gt; door. For myself this worked out extremely well, since nothing helps you understand Java in more depth and detail, than fixing compiler bugs. And understanding Java better than average I consider a prerequisite for successfully working on JDT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;to be continued&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Eclipse Ditto: Support SSH tunneling for managed connections</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/2021-03-31-ssh-tunneling-for-managed-connections.html</guid>
	<link>https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/2021-03-31-ssh-tunneling-for-managed-connections.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the upcoming release of Eclipse Ditto &lt;strong&gt;version 2.0.0&lt;/strong&gt; it will be possible to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ssh-tunneling-for-managed-connections&quot;&gt;SSH tunneling for managed connections&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the upcoming release of Eclipse Ditto version 2.0.0, managed connections support establishing 
an SSH tunnel, which is then used to connect to the actual target endpoint. This is useful when the target endpoint is 
not directly accessible. Currently, this feature is available for all connection types supported in Ditto, except for 
Kafka 2.x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Connection Overview&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/images/blog/2021-04-06-ssh-tunnel-for-managed-connections-shema.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further information, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254#section-7&quot;&gt;Secure Shell (SSH) Connection Protocol, RFC4254&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-connections-with-ssh-tunneling-in-ditto&quot;&gt;Setting up connections with SSH tunneling in Ditto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting up a tunneled connection, the configuration must specify the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sshTunnel&lt;/code&gt; section, which contains 
the necessary information to establish the SSH port forwarding. For authentication, password and public 
key are supported. Also, host validation using public key fingerprints are supported. The tunnel configuration does not 
affect the other parts of your connection configuration. If the feature is enabled the connection will establish an SSH 
tunnel and afterwards use this tunnel to connect to the desired endpoint. In case you later disable the SSH tunnel 
feature, the payload will be processed directly to the desired endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-authentication&quot;&gt;Basic Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using basic authenticating the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sshTunnel&lt;/code&gt; configuration should contain the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;credentials.type&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;, as 
well as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;password&lt;/code&gt; fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On public key authentication the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;credentials.type&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public-key&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;privateKey&lt;/code&gt; have to be provided. The public key must be provided as PEM-encoded key in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;X.509&lt;/code&gt; format. The private 
key must be provided as PEM-encoded key in unencrypted &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PKCS8&lt;/code&gt; format as specified by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468&quot;&gt;RFC-7468&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following command can be used to convert a standard OpenSSL key in PKCS1 format to the PKCS8 format accepted by Ditto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in client-private.pem.key -out client-private.pem.pk8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;host-validation-using-public-key-fingerprints&quot;&gt;Host validation using public key fingerprints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;validateHost&lt;/code&gt; is enabled, the host public key fingerprints are validated. They can be provided 
in the format the standard command line tool &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh-keygen&lt;/code&gt; produces them. The fingerprints are 
prefixed with an alias of the hash algorithm that was used to calculate the fingerprint. Ditto supports the following 
hash algorithms for public key fingerprints: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MD5&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SHA1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SHA224&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SHA256&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SHA384&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SHA512&lt;/code&gt;. To generate a 
valid fingerprint with an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MD5&lt;/code&gt; hash algorithm from the public key, following can be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen -lf id_rsa.pub -E md5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Patrick Paulin: Java monolith to microservice refactoring with Eclipse tooling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.modumind.com/?p=6163</guid>
	<link>https://www.modumind.com/2021/03/30/java-monolith-to-microservice-refactoring-with-eclipse-tooling/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=java-monolith-to-microservice-refactoring-with-eclipse-tooling</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a developer working heavily with OSGi and Eclipse RCP, I’ve spent a lot of time breaking monolithic applications into modules. What I’ve found is that OSGi and it’s associated Eclipse tooling (primarily the Plug-in Development Environment or PDE) are very good at enabling the kind of fine-grained refactoring moves that allows such projects to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking that these technologies and tooling might be useful to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; trying to refactor a Java monolith into microservices. And it turns out you can do this &lt;em&gt;even if you don’t want to build or deploy OSGi bundles&lt;/em&gt;. The tooling can stand on its own and enable a much more powerful and intuitive refactoring workflow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in learning more about this, I’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modumind.com/from-monolith-to-microservices-with-modular-tooling/&quot;&gt;an article that describes both why refactoring is a good approach to microservice extraction and how Eclipse tooling can help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or if you’re interested in meeting with me to find out how this approach could be applied in your projects, why not schedule &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modumind.com/request-for-free-consultation-and-demo/&quot;&gt;a free remote consultation and demo&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>JBoss Tools Team: JBoss Tools 4.19.0.AM1 for Eclipse 2021-03</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://tools.jboss.org/blog/4.19.0.am1.html</guid>

	<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Happy to announce 4.19.0.AM1 (Developer Milestone 1) build for Eclipse 2021-03.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Downloads available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/downloads/jbosstools/2021-03/4.19.0.AM1.html&quot;&gt;JBoss Tools 4.19.0 AM1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-new&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#what-is-new&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is New?&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Full info is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.19.0.AM1.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. Some highlights are below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3 id=&quot;openshift&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#openshift&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OpenShift&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;sect3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h4 id=&quot;browser-based-login-to-an-openshift-cluster&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/blog/news.atom#browser-based-login-to-an-openshift-cluster&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Browser based login to an OpenShift cluster&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When it comes to login to a cluster, OpenShift Tools supported two different authentication mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;user/password&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;token&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The drawback is that it does not cover clusters where a more enhanced and modern authentication infrastructure is in place. So it is now possible to login to the cluster through an embedded web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In order to use it, go to the Login context menu from the Application Explorer view:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;weblogin1&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/weblogin1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;code&gt;Retrieve token&lt;/code&gt; button and an embedded web browser will be displayed:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;weblogin2&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/weblogin2.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Complete the workflow until you see a page that contains &lt;code&gt;Display Token&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since JBoss Tools 4.18.0.Final, the preferred way of developing components is now based on devfile, which is a YAML file that describe how to build the component and if required, launch other containers with other containers.
      When you create a component, you need to specify a devfile that describe your component. So either you component source contains its own devfile or you need to pick a devfile that is related to your component.
      In the second case, OpenShift Tools supports devfile registries that contains a set of different devfiles. There is a default registry (&lt;a class=&quot;bare&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/odo-devfiles/registry&quot;&gt;https://github.com/odo-devfiles/registry&lt;/a&gt;) but you may want to have your own registries. It is now possible to add and remove registries as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The registries are displayed in the OpenShift Application Explorer under the &lt;code&gt;Devfile registries&lt;/code&gt; node:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;registries1&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/registries1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Please note that expanding the registry node will list all devfiles from that registry with a description:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img alt=&quot;registries2&quot; src=&quot;https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/openshift/images/registries2.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A context menu on the &lt;code&gt;Devfile registries&lt;/code&gt; node allows you to add new registries, and on the registry node to delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although devfile registries can provide ready-to-use devfiles, there may be some advanced cases where users need to write their own devfile. As the syntax is quite complex, the YAML editor has been completed so that to provide:&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Niko Stotz: Xtext vs. MPS: Decision Criteria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/?p=465</guid>
	<link>https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/xtext-vs-mps-decision-criteria/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; If we started a new domain-specific language tomorrow, we could choose between different language workbenches or, more general, textual vs. structural / projectional systems. We should decide case-by-case, guided by the criteria targeted user group, tool environment, language properties, input type, environment, model-to-model and model-to-text transformations, extensibility, theory, model evolution, language test support, and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-465&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This post is based on a presentation and discussion we had at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://strumenta.community/&quot;&gt;Strumenta Community&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://nikostotz.de/xtext-vs-mps.pdf&quot;&gt;download the slides&lt;/a&gt;, although reading on might be a bit more clear on the details. Special thanks to &lt;em&gt;Eelco Visser&lt;/em&gt; for his contributions regarding language workbenches besides Xtext and MPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole post wants to answer the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I want to start a new domain-specific language.&lt;br /&gt;
Which criteria shall I think about to decide on a language workbench?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important, and most useless answer to this question is: “It depends.” Every language workbench has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we should assess them anew for each language or project. All criteria mentioned below are worth consideration, and should be balanced towards the needs of the language or project at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every aspect described below &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be realized in any language workbench — if we really wanted to torture ourselves, we could write an ASCII-art text DSL to “draw” diagrams, or force a really complex piece of procedural logic into lines and boxes. On the other hand, an existing text-based processing chain integrates rather well with a textual DSL, and tables work nicely in a structured environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally only know Xtext and MPS good enough to offer an educated opinion; Thankfully, during the presentation several others chimed in to offer additional insights. Thus, we can extend this post’s content (to some degree) to “Textual vs. Structural: Decision Criteria”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: lightgray; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do we mean with &lt;em&gt;textual&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; language workbenches?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a loose distinction, we’re using the rule of thumb “If you directly edit what’s written on disk, it’s textual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Structural&lt;/em&gt; describes both &lt;em&gt;projectional&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;graphical&lt;/em&gt; systems. In &lt;em&gt;projectional&lt;/em&gt; systems, the user has no influence on how things are shown; with &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; systems, the user may have some influence — think of manually layouting a diagram (thanks to &lt;em&gt;Jos Warmer&lt;/em&gt; for this clarification).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of &lt;em&gt;textual&lt;/em&gt; systems include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ANTLR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MontiCore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Racket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rascal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spoofax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xtext&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; systems are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MetaEdit+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sirius&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_targeted_user_group&quot;&gt;Targeted User Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our DSL targeted developers, we might go for a textual system. Developers are used to the powerful tools provided by a good editor or an IDE, and expect this kind of support for handling their “source code” — or, in this case, model. Textual systems might integrate better with their other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we targeted business users, they might prefer a structural system. The main competitor in this field is Excel with hand-crafted validation rules and obscure VBA-scripts attached. Typically, business users can profit more from projectional features like mixing text, tables and diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_tool_environment&quot;&gt;Tool Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our client had an existing infrastructure to deploy Eclipse-based tooling, we probably wanted to leverage that. This implies using an Eclipse-based language workbench like Rascal, Sirius or Xtext. If we wanted model integration with existing tools, EMF would be our best bet, pointing towards Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our client already leaned towards IntelliJ or similar systems, MPS would be more familiar with them. Spoofax supports both Eclipse and IntelliJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_language_properties&quot;&gt;Language Properties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (parts of) our DSL had an established text-based language, we wanted to reuse this existing knowledge in our users and provide a similar textual language. Textual syntax often provides aids to parsers that are difficult to reproduce fluently in structural systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, think of a C-style if-statement. In text, the user types &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, maybe a space, and &lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt; without even thinking about it. In a projectional editor, she still types &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, but the parenthesis is probably automatically added by the projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;// | denotes cursor position
if (|«condition») {
  «statements»
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she typed &lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt;, we would have two bad choices: either we add the parenthesis inside the condition, which is probably not what the user wanted in 95 % of the cases; or we ignore the parenthesis, making the other 5 % really hard to enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important language property is whether we can parse it with reasonable effort and accuracy. For more traditional systems like ANTLR and Xtext, we reach the threshold of unparsable input rather quickly. More advanced systems like Spoofax and Rascal can handle ambiguities well. However, as an extreme example, I doubt we could ever have a parser that reconstructs the semantics of an ASCII-art UML diagram. More realistically, it might be pretty hard for a parser to distinguish mixed free text with unmarked references — think of a free text with some syntactically unmarked references to a user-defined ontology sprinkled in the text: &lt;em&gt;This is free text, with &lt;strong&gt;Ornithopter&lt;/strong&gt;s or other &lt;strong&gt;Dune&lt;/strong&gt; references&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other structures might be parsable, but are very cumbersome to enter — I have yet to see a textual language where writing tables is less than annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to parseability is language integration. Almost all technical languages use traditional parser systems, leading to the joy of escaping: &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;span onclick=&quot;if(myVar.substr(\&quot;\\'\&quot;) &amp;amp;lt; 5) myTag.style = \'.header &amp;amp;gt; ul { font-weight: bold; } \'&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. More modern languages aren’t that pedantic, but try to write the previous sentence in markdown …​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to integrate non-textual content or languages in a textual system, it gets tricky pretty soon. In fact, we had to solve a lot of the problems projectional editors face. As an example, think of the parameter info many IDEs can project in the source code: The Java file contains &lt;tt&gt;myObj.myFunc(&quot;Niko&quot;, false)&lt;/tt&gt;, but the IDE displays &lt;tt&gt;myObj.myFunc(&lt;em&gt;name:&lt;/em&gt; &quot;Niko&quot;, &lt;em&gt;authorized:&lt;/em&gt; false)&lt;/tt&gt;. If the cursor was just right to the opening parenthesis, and we pressed right arrow, would we move to the left or right of the double quotes? What if the user could interact with the projected part, e.g. a color selector? These examples are &lt;em&gt;projected&lt;/em&gt; mix-ins, but it doesn’t get better at all if we imagined the file contents &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw …​&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, and wanted to display an inline pixel editor. The aforementioned table embedded into some text is another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural systems really shine if we wanted to have different editors for the same content, or different viewpoints on the content. To illustrate different editors for the same content, think of a state machine. If we wanted to discuss it with our colleagues, it should be presented in the well-known lines-and-boxes form. We still wanted to retarget a transition or add a state graphically. However, if we had to write it from scratch and had a good structure in mind, or just wanted to refactor an existing one, a text-like representation would be much more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different view points can be as simple as “more or less detail”: in a component model, we might want to see only the connections between components, or also their internal wiring. Textual editors can also hide parts of the content — most IDEs, by default, fold the legal header comment in a source code file.&lt;br /&gt;
As an example of &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; viewpoints, imagine a complex model of a machine that integrates mechanical, electrical, and cost aspects. All of these are interconnected, so the integrated model is very valuable. Hardly anybody would like to see all the details. However, different users would be interested in different combinations: the safety engineer needs to know about currents and moving parts, and the production planner wants to look at costs and parts that are hard to get. In a textual system, we could create reports with such contents, but had to accept serious limitations if we wanted all the viewpoints to be editable (e.g. a complex distribution to different files + projection into a different file).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_input_type&quot;&gt;Input Type&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blank slate can be unsuitable for some types of users and input. If we wanted the user to provide very specific data, we would offer them a form or a wizard. These are very simple &lt;em&gt;structured&lt;/em&gt; systems. A state machine DSL provides the user with much more flexibility, but enforces some structure — we can’t point a transition to another transition, only to a state. In a structured implementation of this DSL, the user would just not be able to create such an invalid transition; a textual DSL would allow to write it, but mark it as erroneous. If our users were developers, they would be used to starting with an empty window, entering the right syntax, and handling error messages. If we targeted people mostly dealing with forms, they might be scared by the empty window, or would not know how to fix the error reported by the system. (“Scared” might sound funny, but there’s quite some anecdotal evidence.) In a structural system, developers might be really annoyed that they have 15 very similar states with only one transition each, but still have to write them as separate multi-line blocks; they felt limited by the rigid structure. For the other group, we could project explanatory texts, and visually separate scaffolding from places where they should enter something; they felt guided by pre-existing structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some degree we can adjust our language design to the appropriate level of flexibility. If we implemented a OO-class like system, we could either allow class content in arbitrary order, or (by grammar / language definition) enforce to first write constructors, then attributes, then public methods, and private methods only at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_environment&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textual systems have been around for a long time, so we know how to integrate them with other systems. Any workflow system can move text files around, and every versioning system can store, merge and diff such files. We understand perfectly how to handle them as build artifacts, and can inspect them on any system with a simple text editor. The Language Server Protocol provides an established technology to use textual languages in web context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any such integration is more complicated with structural systems. It might store its contents in XML or binary, thus we require specific support for version control. As of now (March 2021), I’m not aware of a production-quality structural language workbench based on web technology. I hope this will change within next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if our project does not require tight external integration and targets a desktop environment, a system like MPS provides lots of tooling out-of-the box that’s well integrated with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_transformations_model_to_model&quot;&gt;Transformations: Model-to-Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main distinction for this criteria is between EMF-enabled systems, and others. Our chances to leverage existing transformation technologies, or re-use existing transformations, were pretty good in an EMF ecosystem. EMF provides a very powerful common platform, and a plethora of tooling (both industrial and academic) is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two very strong suits of MPS are intermediate languages, and extensible transformations. EMF provides frameworks to lock several model-to-model transformations into a chain, but it still requires quite some manual work and plumbing. In MPS, this approach is used extensively both by MPS itself, and most of the more complex custom languages I know of. The tool support is excellent; for example, it takes literally one click to inspect all intermediate models of a transformation chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every model-to-model transformation in MPS can be extended by other transformations. It depends on language and transformation design how feasible a specific extension is in practice, but it is used a lot in real-world systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_transformations_model_to_text&quot;&gt;Transformations: Model-to-Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tightly controlling the output of a model-to-text transformation tends to be easier in textual systems. On the one hand, it’s doable to maintain the formatting (i.e. white space, indentation, newlines) of some part of the input. On the other hand, the system is usually designed to output arbitrary text, so we can tweak it as required. Xtend integrates very nice with Xtext (or any other EMF-based system), and provides superior support for model-to-text transformation: It natively supports polymorphic dispatch, and allows to indent generation templates by both the template &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the output structure, with a clear way to tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we didn’t need, or even wanted to prevent, customization of the output, structural systems could be helpful. The final text is structured by the transformation, or post-processed by a pretty printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For MPS, we need to consider whether the output format is available as a language. In this case, we use a chain of model-to-model transformations and have the final model take care of the text output, which usually is very close to the model. Java and XML languages are shipped with MPS, C, JSON, partial C++, partial C#, and others are available from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_extensibility&quot;&gt;Extensibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xtext assumes a closed world, whereas MPS assumes an open world. Thus, if we wanted to tightly control our DSL environment, we have very little effort with Xtext. Using MPS in a controlled environment requires a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if our DSL served as an open platform, MPS inherently offers any kind of extensibility we could wish for. We had to explicitly design each required extension point in Xtext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_conceptual_framework_theory&quot;&gt;Conceptual Framework / Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsers and related text-processing tools are well-researched since the 1970s, and continues to move forward. Computer science build up solid theoretical understanding of the problem and available solutions. We can find several comparable, stable and usable implementations for any major approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural systems are a niche topic in computer science; Eelco &lt;a href=&quot;https://d.strumenta.community/t/academic-research-on-structured-editors/1148&quot;&gt;provided some pointers&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t understand structural editors well enough to come up with sensible, objective ways to compare them. All usable implementations I know of are proprietary (although often Open Source).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_scalability&quot;&gt;Scalability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parsers are around for a long time, we understand pretty well how they can be tuned. They are widely used, so there’s a lot of experience available how to design a language to be efficiently parsable. Xtext has been used in production with gigabyte-sized models. The same experience provides us with very performant editors. I’d expect a textual system to fail more graceful if we closed in on its limits: loading, purely displaying the content, syntax highlighting, folding, navigation, validation, and generation should scale differently, and the system should be partially useful/usable with a subset of remaining operational aspects. If a model became too big for our tooling, we could always fall back to plain text editors; they can edit files of any size. We also know how to generate from very big models: C++ compilers build up completely inlined files of several hundreds of megabytes; the aforementioned gigabyte-sized Xtext models are processed by generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical experience with MPS shows scalability issues in several aspects. The default serialization format stores one model with all its root nodes in one XML file. Performance degrades seriously for larger models. Using any of the other default serialization formats (XML per root node; binary) helps a lot. The editor is always rendered completely. Depending on the editor implementation, it might be re-rendered by every model change, or even every cursor navigation. I’m not aware of any comprehensive guide how to tackle editor performance issues (in my experience, we should try to avoid the flow layout for bigger parts of the editor). The biggest performance issue with possibly any structural system is the missing fallback: Once we have a model too big for the system (e.g. by import), it’s very hard to do something about the model’s size, as we would need the system to actually edit the model. Thankfully, we can still edit the model programmatically in most cases. Both validation and generation performance in MPS highly depends on the language implementation. The model-to-model transformation approach tends to use quite some memory; I’d assume model-to-model transformations (with free model navigation) to be harder to optimize for memory usage than model-to-text transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_model_evolution&quot;&gt;Model Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xtext does not provide any specific support for model evolution. As conceptual advantage of textual systems, we can migrate models with text processing tools. Search / replace or &lt;em&gt;sed&lt;/em&gt; can be sufficient for smaller changes to model instances. As a drawback, we cannot store any meta-information in the model, but out of sight (and manipulation) of the user. Thus, we have to put version information in some way directly into our language content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPS stores the used language version with every model instance. It detects if a newer version is available, and can run migration scripts on the instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_language_test&quot;&gt;Language Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most aspects of Xtext-based languages are implemented in Java (or another JVM language), enabling regular JUnit-based tests. Xtext ships with some utilities to simplify such tests, and to ease tests for parsing errors. Xpect, an auxiliary language to Xtext, allows to embed language-specific tests like validation, auto-complete and scoping in comments of example model instances. In practice, most transformation tests compare the generated output to some reference by text comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, MPS does not support (or need) parsing tests. It provides specific tests for editors, generators, and other language aspects. The editor tests support checking interaction schemes like cursor movement, intentions, or auto-complete. Generator tests are hardly usable in practice, as they require the generated output model to identical to a reference model, and don’t allow to check intermediate models. The tests for other language aspects use language extensibility to annotate regular models with checks for validation, scoping, type calculation etc. MPS provides technically separated language aspects, and specific DSLs, for e.g. scoping or validation. They are efficient, but make it hard to test contained logic with regular JUnit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_longevity&quot;&gt;Longevity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can safely assume we will always be able to open text files once we can read the storage media. Text could even be printed. It’s a bit less clear whether parsing technology in 50 years time will easily cope with the structures of today’s languages. Today’s (traditional, as described above) parsers would have a hard time parsing something like PL/1, where any keyword can be used as identifier in an unambiguous context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we stored structured models in binary, it might be very hard to retrieve the contents if the system itself was lost. If we used an XML dialect, we could probably recover the basic structures (containment + type, reference + type, metatype, property) of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume we lost the DSL system itself, and only know the model instances, or cannot modify the DSL system. (This scenario is not extremely unlikely — there are a lot of productive mainframe programs without available source code.) I don’t have a clear opinion whether it would be easier to filter out all the “noise” from a parsed text file to recover the underlying concepts, or to reassemble the basic structures from an XML file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the more probable case, our DSL system is outdated, but we can still run and modify it, e.g. in a virtual environment. Then we can write an exporter that uses the original retrival logic (irrespective of parsing or structured model loading), and export the model contents to a suitable format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Lorenzo Bettini: Publishing an Eclipse p2 composite repository on GitHub Pages</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.lorenzobettini.it/?p=1327</guid>
	<link>http://www.lorenzobettini.it/2021/03/publishing-an-eclipse-p2-composite-repository-on-github-pages/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had already described the process of publishing an Eclipse p2 composite update site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lorenzobettini.it/2016/02/publish-an-eclipse-p2-composite-repository-on-bintray/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Publish an Eclipse p2 composite repository on Bintray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lorenzobettini.it/2015/01/publish-an-eclipse-p2-repository-on-sourceforge-with-rsync/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Publish an Eclipse p2 repository on Sourceforge with rsync&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bintray is shutting down&lt;/a&gt;, and Sourceforge is quite slow in serving an Eclipse update site, I decided to publish my Eclipse p2 composite update sites on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages might not be ideal for serving binaries, and it has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#guidelines-for-using-github-pages&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;few limitations&lt;/a&gt;. However, such limitations (e.g., published sites may be no larger than 1 GB, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour) are not that crucial for an Eclipse update site, whose artifacts are not that huge. Moreover, at least my projects are not going to serve more than 100GB per month, unfortunately, I might say &lt;img alt=&quot;ðŸ˜‰&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I’ll show how to do that, so that you can easily apply this procedure also to your projects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure is part of the Maven/Tycho build so that it is fully automated. Moreover, the pom.xml and the ant files can be fully reused in your own projects (just a few properties have to be adapted). &lt;strong&gt;The idea is that you can run this Maven build (basically, “mvn deploy”) on any CI server&lt;/strong&gt; (as long as you have write-access to the GitHub repository hosting the update site – more on that later). &lt;strong&gt;Thus, you will not depend on the pipeline syntax of a specific CI server&lt;/strong&gt; (Travis, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.), though, depending on the specific CI server you might have to adjust a few minimal things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the main points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Eclipse project is hosted on a GitHub repository. The example used in this tutorial can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The corresponding composite update site is hosted on another GitHub repository; in such a repository, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publishing source for GitHub Pages is configured to be based on the &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; branch&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the defaultÂ &lt;em&gt;gh-pages&lt;/em&gt; branch. The GitHub repository for the composite update site for this example can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates&lt;/a&gt; and can be used as an Eclipse update site by using the URL &lt;a href=&quot;https://lorenzobettini.github.io/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://lorenzobettini.github.io/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates&lt;/a&gt;, following the standard GitHub Pages convention. You must first create this GitHub repository and initialize it with at least one commit. You can configure the source for GitHub pages even afterward, at most, before announcing your update site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The p2 children repositories and the p2 composite repositories will be published with standard Git operations since we publish them in a GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s recap what p2 composite update sites are. Quoting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Composite_Repositories_(new)&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Composite_Repositories_(new)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As repositories continually grow in size they become harder to manage. The goal of composite repositories is to make this task easier by allowing you to have a parent repository which refers to multiple children. Users are then able to reference the parent repository and the childrenâ€™s content will transparently be available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve this, all published p2 repositories must be available, each one with its own p2 metadata that should never be overwritten.Â On the contrary, the metadata that we will overwrite will be the one for the composite metadata, i.e., &lt;em&gt;compositeContent.xml&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;compositeArtifacts.xml&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Directory Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to serve these composite update sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the main one collects all the versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a composite update site for each major version (e.g., 1.x, 2.x, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a composite update site for each major.minor version (e.g., 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 2.0.x, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I aim at is to have the following paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;releases&lt;/strong&gt;: in this directory, all p2 simple repositories will be uploaded, each one in its own directory, named after version.buildQualifier, e.g., 1.0.0.v20210307-2037, 1.1.0.v20210307-2104, etc. Your Eclipse users can then use the URL of one of these single update sites to stick to that specific version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;updates&lt;/strong&gt;: in this directory, the metadata for major and major.minor composite sites will be uploaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt;: the main composite update site collecting all versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, we’ll end up with a remote directory structure like the following one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;â”œâ”€â”€ compositeArtifacts.xml
â”œâ”€â”€ compositeContent.xml

    â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ p2.index
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ compositeArtifacts.xml
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ compositeContent.xml

        â”œâ”€â”€ compositeContent.xml
        â””â”€â”€ p2.index&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, if you want, you can provide these sites to your users (I’m using the URLs that correspond to my example):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://lorenzobettini.github.io/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates&lt;/strong&gt; for the main global update site: every new version will be available when using this site;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://lorenzobettini.github.io/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates/updates/1.x&lt;/strong&gt; for all the releases with major version 1: for example, the user won’t see new releases with major version 2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://lorenzobettini.github.io/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates/updates/1.x/1.0.x&lt;/strong&gt; for all the releases with major version 1 and minor version 0: the user will only see new releases of the shape 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc., but NOT 1.1.0, 1.2.3, 2.0.0, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to change this structure, you have to carefully tweak the ant file we’ll see in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the build, before the actual deployment, we’ll have to update the composite site metadata, and we’ll have to do that locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps that we’ll perform during the Maven/Tycho build are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone the repository hosting the composite update site (in this example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates&lt;/a&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the p2 repository (with Tycho, as usual);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the p2 repository in the cloned repository in a subdirectory of the &lt;em&gt;releases&lt;/em&gt; directory (the name of the subdirectory has the same qualified version of the project, e.g., 1.0.0.v20210307-2037);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the composite update sites information in the cloned repository (using the p2 tools);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit and push the updated clone to the remote GitHub repository (the one hosting the composite update site).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, in the parent POM, we define the following properties, which of course you need to tweak for your own projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Required properties for releasing --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;github-update-repo&amp;gt;git@github.com:LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates.git&amp;lt;/github-update-repo&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;github-local-clone&amp;gt;${project.build.directory}/checkout&amp;lt;/github-local-clone&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;releases-directory&amp;gt;${github-local-clone}/releases&amp;lt;/releases-directory&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;current-release-directory&amp;gt;${releases-directory}/${qualifiedVersion}&amp;lt;/current-release-directory&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- The label for the Composite sites --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;site.label&amp;gt;Composite Site Example&amp;lt;/site.label&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be clear which properties you need to modify for your project. In particular, theÂ &lt;em&gt;github-update-repo&lt;/em&gt; is the URL (with authentication information) of the GitHub repository hosting the composite update site, and the &lt;em&gt;site.label&lt;/em&gt; is the label that will be put in the composite metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in the parent POM, we configure in the &lt;em&gt;pluginManagement&lt;/em&gt; section all the versions of the plugin we are going to use (see the sources of the example on GitHub).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting configuration is the one for theÂ &lt;em&gt;tycho-packaging-plugin&lt;/em&gt;, where we specify the format of the qualified version:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.eclipse.tycho&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;tycho-packaging-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${tycho-version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;format&amp;gt;'v'yyyyMMdd'-'HHmm&amp;lt;/format&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we create a profileÂ &lt;strong&gt;release-composite&lt;/strong&gt; (which we’ll also use later in the POM of the &lt;i&gt;site&lt;/i&gt; project), where we disable the standard Maven plugins forÂ &lt;em&gt;install&lt;/em&gt; andÂ &lt;em&gt;deploy&lt;/em&gt;. Since we are going to release our Eclipse p2 composite update site during the deploy phase, but we are not interested in installing and deploying the Maven artifacts, we skip the standard Maven plugins bound to those phases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;profile&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;!-- Activate this profile to perform the release to GitHub Pages --&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;/pluginManagement&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/build&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/profile&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interesting steps are in theÂ &lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt; project, the one withÂ &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;packaging&amp;gt;eclipse-repository&amp;lt;/packaging&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Here we also define the profileÂ &lt;strong&gt;release-composite&lt;/strong&gt; and we use a few plugins to perform the steps involving the Git repository described above (remember that these configurations are inside the profile release-composite, of course in the &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;plugins&lt;/em&gt; section):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s see these configurations in detail. In particular, it is important to understand how the goals of the plugins are bound to the phases of the default lifecycle; remember that on the phase &lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt;, Tycho will automatically create the p2 repository and it will do that before any other goals bound to the phase &lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt; in the above configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with theÂ &lt;em&gt;build-helper-maven-plugin&lt;/em&gt; we parse the current version of the project, in particular, we set the properties holding the major and minor versions that we need later to create the composite metadata directory structure; its goal is automatically bound to one of the first phases (&lt;em&gt;validate&lt;/em&gt;) of the lifecycle;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with theÂ &lt;em&gt;exec-maven-plugin&lt;/em&gt; we configure the execution of the Git commands:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we clone the Git repository of the update site (withÂ &lt;em&gt;–depth=1&lt;/em&gt; we only get the latest commit in the history, the previous commits are not interesting for our task); this is done in the phaseÂ &lt;em&gt;pre-package&lt;/em&gt;, that is before the p2 repository is created by Tycho; the Git repository is cloned in the output directoryÂ &lt;em&gt;target/checkout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the phaseÂ &lt;em&gt;verify&lt;/em&gt; (that is, after the phaseÂ &lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt;), we commit the changes (which will be done during the phaseÂ &lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt; as shown in the following points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the phaseÂ &lt;em&gt;deploy&lt;/em&gt; (that is, the last phase that we’ll run on the command line), we push the changes to the Git repository of the update site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with theÂ &lt;em&gt;maven-resources-plugin&lt;/em&gt; we copy the p2 repository generated by Tycho into theÂ &lt;em&gt;target/checkout/releases&lt;/em&gt; directory in a subdirectory with the name of the qualified version of the project (e.g., 1.0.0.v20210307-2037);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with theÂ &lt;em&gt;tycho-eclipserun-plugin&lt;/em&gt; we create the composite metadata; we rely on the Eclipse application &lt;em&gt;org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner&lt;/em&gt;, so that we can execute the p2 Ant task for managing composite repositories (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Composite_Repositories_(new)#Composite_Repositories_as_part_of_the_build&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;p2.composite.repository&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Ant tasks are defined in the Ant file &lt;strong&gt;packaging-p2composite.ant&lt;/strong&gt;, stored in the &lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt; project. In this file, there are also a few properties that describe the layout of the directories described before. Note that we need to pass a few properties, including theÂ &lt;em&gt;site.label&lt;/em&gt;, the directory of the local Git clone, and the major and minor versions that we computed before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that in all the above steps, non-existing directories will be automatically created on-demand (e.g., by the &lt;em&gt;maven-resources-plugin&lt;/em&gt; and by the p2 Ant tasks). This means that the described process will work seamlessly the very first time when we start with an empty Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, from the parent POM on your computer, it’s enough to run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;mvn deploy -Prelease-composite&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;and the release will be performed. When cloning you’ll be asked for the password of the GitHub repository, and, if not using an SSH agent or a keyring, also when pushing. Again, this depends on the URL of the GitHub repository; you might use an HTTPS URL that relies on the GitHub token, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a few local tests before actually releasing, you might stop at the phaseÂ &lt;em&gt;verify&lt;/em&gt; and inspect theÂ &lt;em&gt;target/checkout&lt;/em&gt; to see whether the directories and the composite metadata are as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also want to add anotherÂ &lt;em&gt;execution&lt;/em&gt; to theÂ &lt;em&gt;tycho-eclipserun-plugin&lt;/em&gt; to add a reference to another Eclipse update site that is required to install your software. The Ant file provides a task for that,Â &lt;em&gt;p2.composite.add.external&lt;/em&gt; that will store the reference into the innermost composite child (e.g., into 1.2.x); here’s an example that adds a reference to the Eclipse main update site:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;!-- Add composite of required software update sites... 
    (if already present they won't be added again) --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;add-eclipse-repository&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in my Xtext projects, I use this technique to add a reference to the Xtext update site corresponding to the Xtext version I’m using in that specific release of my project. This way, my update site will be “self-contained” for my users: when using my update site for installing my software, p2 will be automatically able to install also the required Xtext bundles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Releasing from GitHub Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maven command shown above can be used to perform a release from your computer. If you want to release your Eclipse update site directly from GitHub Actions, there are a few more things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we are talking about a GitHub Actions workflow stored and executed in the GitHub repository of your project, NOT in the GitHub repository of the update site. In this example, it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a workflow, we need to push to another GitHub repository. To do that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitHub personal access token&lt;/a&gt; (selectingÂ &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a secret in the GitHub repository of the project (where we run the GitHub Actions workflow), in this example it is called &lt;em&gt;ACTIONS_TOKEN&lt;/em&gt;, with the value of that token;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when running the Maven deploy command, we need to override the propertyÂ &lt;em&gt;github-update-repo&lt;/em&gt; by specifying a URL for the GitHub repository with the update site using the HTTPS syntax and the encrypted &lt;em&gt;ACTIONS_TOKEN&lt;/em&gt;; in this example, it is &lt;em&gt;https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.ACTIONS_TOKEN }}@github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we also need to configure in advance the GitÂ &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt; andÂ &lt;em&gt;email&lt;/em&gt;, with some values, otherwise, Git will complain when creating the commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, these are the interesting parts of theÂ &lt;em&gt;release.yml&lt;/em&gt; workflow (see the full version here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;name: Release with Maven

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 11
    - name: Configure Git
      run: |
        git config --global user.name 'GitHub Actions'
        git config --global user.email 'lorenzo.bettini@users.noreply.github.com'
    - name: Build with Maven
      run: &amp;gt;
        mvn deploy
        -Prelease-composite
        -Dgithub-update-repo=https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.ACTIONS_TOKEN }}@github.com/LorenzoBettini/p2composite-github-pages-example-updates
      working-directory: p2composite.example.parent&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workflow is configured to be executed only when you push to theÂ &lt;strong&gt;release&lt;/strong&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that we are talking about the Git repository hosting your project, not the one hosting your update site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the procedure described in this post, you publish your update sites and the composite metadata during the Maven build, so you never deal manually with the GitHub repository of your update site. However, you can always do that! For example, you might want to remove a release. It’s just a matter of cloning that repository, do your changes (i.e., remove a subdirectory ofÂ &lt;em&gt;releases&lt;/em&gt; and update manually the composite metadata accordingly), commit, and push. Now and then you might also clean up the history of such a Git repository (the history is not important in this context), by pushing withÂ &lt;em&gt;–force&lt;/em&gt; after resetting the Git history. By the way, by tweaking the configurations above you could also do that every time you do a release: just commit withÂ &lt;em&gt;amend&lt;/em&gt; andÂ &lt;em&gt;push force&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you could also create an additional GitHub repository for snapshot releases of your update sites, or for milestones, or release candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy releasing! &lt;img alt=&quot;ðŸ™‚&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>itemis: An open source policy language for Attribute-Stream Based Access Control (ASBAC)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://blogs.itemis.com/en/an-open-source-policy-language-for-attribute-stream-based-access-control-asbac</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.itemis.com/en/an-open-source-policy-language-for-attribute-stream-based-access-control-asbac</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article discusses, how the Streaming Attribute Policy Language (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sapl.io/&quot;&gt;SAPL&lt;/a&gt;) can be applied to realize complex authorization scenarios by formulating rules for access control in an easy to use policy language implemented using Xtext.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;This article covers:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Basic concepts and motivation for Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) in general and Attribute-Stream Based Access Control (ASBAC) in particular&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;How to express access rights policies using SAPL&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;How SAPL can be used in Spring Boot applications integrating the access policies&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Externalized dynamic policy-driven access control&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Often applications allow different degrees of access control following role-based concepts (RBAC). Different roles are assigned to individual within the identity management system. This may include hierarchical role concepts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The number of applications to be managed within an organization is typically increasing over time. Managing access to the different resources correctly results in an &lt;strong&gt;explosion of roles&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore a matching increase in complexity in maintaining the integrity of access control as it becomes increasingly harder to define the right roles and correct assignments to individuals or groups.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In addition, role-based mechanisms are often not capable of expressing all access control requirements of a given application domain.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One way to overcome these problems is to employ so-called &lt;strong&gt;attribute-based access control (ABAC)&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of assigning specific permissions to the role attribute of a subject directly, i.e., the entity requesting access to a resource, a set of policies defines rules under which conditions access is granted.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Those rules are based on properties or attributes of the subject, resource, action (i.e., what does the subject want to do with the resource) and environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Chart showing the attribute-based access control mechanism&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2021)/An%20open%20source%20policy%20language%20for%20Attribute-Stream%20Based%20Access%20Control%20(ASBAC)/attribute-based_access_control_mechanism.png?width=850&amp;amp;name=attribute-based_access_control_mechanism.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 850px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally in ABAC the code path where resources are to be protected (&lt;strong&gt;Policy Enforcement Point&lt;/strong&gt; or PEP) sends the question “May SUBJECT do ACTION with RESOURCE in ENVIRONMENT” to a so-called &lt;strong&gt;Policy Decision Point (PDP)&lt;/strong&gt;. This then calculates the decision based on the rules and attributes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Attributes may be directly attached to the objects in the question or may be retrieved from external sources if specified by the policies in question.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Following such a model has several &lt;strong&gt;advantages&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;It allows to decouple most of the access control logic from the domain logic, for a clear separation of concerns&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The access control rules can be changed by configuration/administration independently of and during deployment of the applications&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The model can express more complex access control rules than RBAC or access control lists (ACLs) and allows for implementing these well-established models where applicable. And offers an upgrade path to other rules, often without touching code&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These benefits come at the cost of a certain degree of complexity introduced through the required infrastructure which should be considered on a case-to-case basis.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The primary way of implementing ABAC was to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html&quot;&gt;XACML standard&lt;/a&gt; which specifies an architecture, protocol and XML scheme for specifying policies. Both open source and proprietary XACML implementations exist. However, XACML by itself is a relatively verbose XML-based standard which is difficult to author and to read by a person.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While a standard for a more readable dialect of XACML in form of a DSL exists with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/55228/alfa-for-xacml-v1.0-wd01.doc&quot;&gt;ALFA&lt;/a&gt; only one proprietary implementation exists.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Streaming Attribute Policy Language (SAPL)&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While XACML as the de-facto standard has its problems in syntax and expressiveness, e.g. parametrization of attribute access, it also is still rooted in a traditional request-response design. Thus, in cases where conditions implying access rights are expected to change regularly, applications must poll the policy decision point to keep up, resulting in latency and scalability issues in access control.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Streaming Attribute Policy Language (SAPL) introduces an extension to the ABAC model&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing for data stream-based attributes and publish-subscribe driven access control design patterns, the so-called Attribute-Stream Based Access Control (ASBAC).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;attribute-stream_based_access_control_mechanism&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2021)/An%20open%20source%20policy%20language%20for%20Attribute-Stream%20Based%20Access%20Control%20(ASBAC)/attribute-stream_based_access_control_mechanism.png?width=850&amp;amp;name=attribute-stream_based_access_control_mechanism.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 850px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The data model of SAPL is based on JSON and JSON Path. A policy enforcement point formulates authorization subscriptions as JSON objects containing arbitrary JSON values for subject, action, and resource. Policies are expressed in intuitive syntax. Here are a few examples of SAPL policies.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Full source of working example projects can be found here on GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/heutelbeck/sapl-demos&quot;&gt;https://github.com/heutelbeck/sapl-demos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Also, this article will not go into the details of the syntax of SAPL but rather explain what the policies do. A full documentation is available under &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapl.io/docs/sapl-reference.html&quot;&gt;https://sapl.io/docs/sapl-reference.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First let us look at &lt;strong&gt;policies&lt;/strong&gt; which are used in a traditional request-response driven system &lt;strong&gt;integrated into a Spring Boot application using the SAPL Spring Boot Starter&lt;/strong&gt; providing a deep Spring Security integration. Given the following repository, the SAPL integration automatically generates policy enforcement points for methods annotated by &lt;code&gt;@PreEnforce&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@PostEnforce&lt;/code&gt; controlling entry or exit to the method. The SAPL subscriptions are derived by reflection and accessing the principal objects of the runtime.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SAPL code example - policies&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2021)/An%20open%20source%20policy%20language%20for%20Attribute-Stream%20Based%20Access%20Control%20(ASBAC)/SAPL_code_example-policies_03.png?width=720&amp;amp;name=SAPL_code_example-policies_03.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 720px; display: block; margin: 25px auto;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The next policies are excerpts of a more complete policy set expressed in SAPL.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SAPL code example - more complete policy set&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2021)/An%20open%20source%20policy%20language%20for%20Attribute-Stream%20Based%20Access%20Control%20(ASBAC)/SAPL_code_example-more_complete_policy_set_04.png?width=720&amp;amp;name=SAPL_code_example-more_complete_policy_set_04.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 720px; display: block; margin: 25px auto;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This policy is a simple implementation of role-based access control for the &lt;code&gt;findById&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SAPL code example - RBAC implementation for findById method&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2021)/An%20open%20source%20policy%20language%20for%20Attribute-Stream%20Based%20Access%20Control%20(ASBAC)/SAPL_code_example-RBAC_implementation_for_findById_method_05.png?width=720&amp;amp;name=SAPL_code_example-RBAC_implementation_for_findById_method_05.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 720px; display: block; margin: 25px auto;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;As can be seen in the repository definition, the method &lt;code&gt;findById&lt;/code&gt; is annotated with &lt;code&gt;@PostEnforce&lt;/code&gt; so the resource JSON object is a serialization of the return value of the method and this policy transforms the data and blackens substrings of the data for administrators which should not have access to medical data.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This kind of filtering and transformation is not possible with XACML. This is combined with a traditional role-based access control by using the authority attribute of the subject. In case access is granted, the return value of the method will be replaced by the transformed object.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img alt=&quot;SAPL code example&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2021)/An%20open%20source%20policy%20language%20for%20Attribute-Stream%20Based%20Access%20Control%20(ASBAC)/SAPL_code_example_06.png?width=720&amp;amp;name=SAPL_code_example_06.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 720px; display: block; margin: 25px auto;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this policy uses an external data source to fetch additional attributes. In line 16, the policy accesses the patient repository itself and retrieves a list of relatives. And if the user is a relative, it may access, but with certain fields of the dataset removed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So far, the use of the policies all adhered to the request-response pattern. The following example does use stream-based attributes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SAPL code example&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2021)/An%20open%20source%20policy%20language%20for%20Attribute-Stream%20Based%20Access%20Control%20(ASBAC)/SAPL_code_example_07.png?width=720&amp;amp;name=SAPL_code_example_07.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 720px; display: block; margin: 25px auto;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With two custom attribute implementations, this simple policy integrates an IoT physical access control system and a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain which allow for quasi-real-time enforcement of the rule that only persons on the company premises who hold a certification to access the resource may access it. The angled bracket syntax denotes that the authorization subscription results in a subscription the matching external data stream source.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This article can only scratch the surface of the possibilities for SAPL, its engine and tools.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAPL was implemented using Xtext&lt;/strong&gt;, which made it easy to concentrate on designing a &lt;strong&gt;user-friendly syntax&lt;/strong&gt; and runtime instead of reinventing the wheel for DSL processing. It also allowed for developing &lt;strong&gt;web-based policy editors&lt;/strong&gt; for the server applications and significantly reduced the time needed to get from zero to the first running prototype.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;SAPL itself is an open source project licensed under the Apace 2.0 project.&lt;br /&gt;Learn more about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapl.io&quot;&gt;https://sapl.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Denis Roy: Why Vendor Neutrality is important</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">6933 at https://blogs.eclipse.org</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/denis-roy/why-vendor-neutrality-important</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're seeing a trend of free (as in beer) resources being discontinued, or altered, with very little time provided to allow projects to react. This causes pain for OSS projects that use and depend on these services. The trend is certainly not new, and although there's certainly a case for the you-get-what-you-pay-for mantra, it's clear that relying on a single-vendor, third-party &quot;free&quot; resource is not without its risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two recent cases come to mind: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-upcoming-docker-hub-rate-limiting/&quot;&gt;Dockerhub pull rate limits.&lt;/a&gt; With about 2 months of notice, projects around the globe scrambled to fix release engineering processes to accommodate the upcoming limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/&quot;&gt;JFrog terminating BinTray and others&lt;/a&gt;. With just under three months to react, projects who depend on these services need to find a new home for their binary distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When relying on single-vendor services, or single-vendor open-source projects, or single-vendor anything for that matter, your assurance that you're not relying on a ticking time bomb is nil. At the Eclipse Foundation, we don't depend on a single vendor. In fact, we shy away from solutions that include the words Proprietary, Vendor, Closed and Licensed.  A quick search for &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=eclipse+vendor+neutral&amp;amp;oq=eclipse+vendor+neutral&quot;&gt;eclipse vendor neutral&lt;/a&gt;&quot; will provide dozens of examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse Foundation does rely on some vendor products - GitLab and GitHub, for instance. We do need to strike a logical and reasonable balance between Vendor Neutrality and Ease of Use. We do, however, ensure two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying data model is Open. In both those examples, the data is Git, and Git is not proprietary technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That we have a Plan B, should the vendor suddely change the playing field. We actively back up Eclipse project repositories that are on GitHub. The backup is a plain git clone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vendor Neutrality, along with those two strategies for dealing with vendor products and services, allow the Foundation to ensure project services are maintained with minimal risk or potential disruption from a single third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

   &lt;p&gt;Since a couple of years, the Eclipse platform jars are &lt;a href=&quot;https://jmini.github.io/blog/2017/2017-01-10_use-eclipse-jdt-in-java-app.html&quot;&gt;published on maven central&lt;/a&gt; with metadata that allows the consumption in a traditional maven project (no &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tycho&quot;&gt;Eclipse Tycho&lt;/a&gt; required).&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;This article is my feedback after having experimented with PDE (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/pde/&quot;&gt;Plug-in Development Environment&lt;/a&gt; project).&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt; 
 &lt;h2 id=&quot;the_problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;The goal is to compile and execute code that requires this OSGi bundle from maven-central:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.eclipse.pde&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;org.eclipse.pde.core&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;3.13.200&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;I am using a regular maven project (with the bnd plugins to manage the OSGi related tasks). I do not have Eclipse Tycho, so maven do not have access to any P2 Update Site.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;Amongst all dependencies of PDE, there is &lt;code&gt;org.eclipse.e4.core.contexts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;org.eclipse.e4.core.services&lt;/code&gt;. Those two bundles requires:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-MF&quot;&gt;Import-Package: javax.inject;version=&quot;1.0.0&quot;,&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.runtime/blob/9541c1ee0b599c4b7666fca6fdbfdba3eb3d1979/bundles/org.eclipse.e4.core.contexts/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF#L11&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.runtime/blob/9541c1ee0b599c4b7666fca6fdbfdba3eb3d1979/bundles/org.eclipse.e4.core.services/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF#L11&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;So we need a bundle exporting this package, otherwise the requirements are not fulfilled and I get this error:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;

	<title>Chris Aniszczyk: Cloud Native Predictions for 2021 and Beyond</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.aniszczyk.org/?p=4372</guid>
	<link>https://www.aniszczyk.org/2021/01/19/cloud-native-predictions-for-2021-and-beyond/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday break as the first couple weeks of January 2021 have been pretty wild, from insurrections to new COVID strains. In cloud native land, the CNCF recently released its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cncf.io/cncf-annual-report-2020/&quot;&gt;annual report&lt;/a&gt; on all the work we accomplished last year. I recommend everyone take an opportunity to go through the report, we had a solid year given the wild pandemic circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn/status/1343914259177222145
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of my job, I have a unique and privileged vantage point of cloud native trends given to all the member companies and developers I work with, so I figured I’d share my thoughts of where things will be going in 2021 and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Native IDEs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a person who has spent a decent portion of his career working on developer tools inside the Eclipse Foundation, I am nothing but thrilled with the recent progress of the state of the art. The future will hold that the development lifecycle (code, build, debug) will happen mostly in the cloud versus your local Emacs or VSCode setup. You will end up getting a full dev environment setup for every pull request, pre-configured and connected to their own deployment to aid your development and debugging needs. A concrete example of this technology today is enabled via GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/codespaces&quot;&gt;Codespaces&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitpod.io/&quot;&gt;GitPod&lt;/a&gt;. While GitHub Codespaces is still in beta, you can try this experience live today with GitPod, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus&quot;&gt;Prometheus as an example&lt;/a&gt;. In a minute or so, you have a completely live development environment with an editor and preview environment. The wild thing is that this development environment (workspace) is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/.gitpod.yml&quot;&gt;described in code&lt;/a&gt; and shareable with other developers on your team like any other code artifact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end, I expect to see incredible innovation in the cloud native IDE space over the next year, especially as GitHub Codespaces enters out of beta and becomes more widely available so developers can experience this new concept and fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes on the Edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes was born through usage across massive data centers but Kubernetes will evolve just like Linux did for new environments. What happened with Linux was that end users eventually stretched the kernel to support a variety of new deployment scenarios from mobile, embedded and more. I strongly believe Kubernetes will go through a similar evolution and we are already witnessing Telcos (and startups) explore Kubernetes as an edge platform through transforming VNFs into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cncf/cnf-wg&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Network Functions&lt;/a&gt; (CNFs) along with open source projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://k3s.io/&quot;&gt;k3s&lt;/a&gt;, KubeEdge, k0s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lfedge.org&quot;&gt;LFEdge&lt;/a&gt;, Eclipse ioFog and more. The forces driving hyperscaler clouds to support telcos and the edge, combined with the ability to reuse cloud native software and build upon already a large ecosystem will cement Kubernetes as a dominant platform in edge computing over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Native + Wasm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webassembly.org/&quot;&gt;Web Assembly&lt;/a&gt; (Wasm) is a technology that is nascent but I expect it to become a growing utility and workload in the cloud native ecosystem especially as &lt;a href=&quot;https://wasi.dev/&quot;&gt;WASI&lt;/a&gt; matures and as Kubernetes is used more as an edge orchestrator as described previously. One use case is powering an extension mechanism, like what Envoy does with filters and LuaJIT. Instead of dealing with Lua directly, you can work with a smaller optimized runtime that supports a variety of programming languages. The Envoy project is currently in its journey in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solo.io/blog/the-state-of-webassembly-in-envoy-proxy/&quot;&gt;adopting Wasm&lt;/a&gt; and I expect a similar pattern to follow for any environment that scripting languages are a popular extension mechanism to be wholesale replaced by Wasm in the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Kubernetes front, there are projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://deislabs.io/posts/introducing-krustlet/&quot;&gt;Krustlet&lt;/a&gt; from Microsoft that are exploring how a WASI-based runtime could be supported in Kubernetes. This shouldn’t be too surprising as Kubernetes is already being extended via CRDs and other mechanisms to run different types of workloads like VMs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://kubevirt.io/&quot;&gt;KubeVirt&lt;/a&gt;) and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, if you’re new to Wasm, I recommend this new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-webassembly-runtime&quot;&gt;intro course&lt;/a&gt; from the Linux Foundation that goes over the space, along with the excellection documentation &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rise of FinOps (CFM)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus outbreak has accelerated the shift to cloud native. At least half of companies are accelerating their cloud plans amid the crisis… nearly 60% of respondents said cloud usage would exceed prior plans owing to the COVID-19 pandemic (&lt;a href=&quot;https://info.flexera.com/SLO-CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud-2020&quot;&gt;State of the Cloud Report 2020&lt;/a&gt;). On top of that, Cloud Financial Management (or FinOps) is a growing issue and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/cloud-bills-will-get-loftier-1518363001&quot;&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; for many companies and honestly comes up in about half of my discussions the last six months with companies navigating their cloud native journey. You can also argue that cloud providers aren’t incentivized to make cloud financial management easier as that would make it easier for customers to spend less, however, the true pain is lack of open source innovation and standardization around cloud financial management in my opinion (all the clouds do cost management differently). In the CNCF context, there aren’t many open source projects trying to make FinOps easier, there is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubecost/cost-model&quot;&gt;KubeCost&lt;/a&gt; project but it’s fairly early days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, the Linux Foundation recently launched the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finops.org/blog/linux-foundation&quot;&gt;FinOps Foundation&lt;/a&gt;” to help innovation in this space, they have some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-finops&quot;&gt;great introductory materials&lt;/a&gt; in this space. I expect to see a lot more open source projects and specifications in the FinOps space in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Rust in Cloud Native&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rust is still a young and niche programming language, especially if you look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/07/27/language-rankings-6-20/&quot;&gt;programming language rankings&lt;/a&gt; from Redmonk as an example. However, my feeling is that you will see Rust in more cloud native projects over the coming year given that there are already a handful of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/06/22/rust-at-cncf/&quot;&gt;CNCF projects taking advantage of Rust&lt;/a&gt; to it popping up in interesting infrastructure projects like the microvm &lt;a href=&quot;https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/&quot;&gt;Firecracker&lt;/a&gt;. While CNCF currently has a super majority of projects written in Golang, I expect Rust-based projects to be on par with Go-based ones in a couple of years as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/08/18/laying-the-foundation-for-rusts-future.html&quot;&gt;Rust community matures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitOps + CD/PD Grows Significantly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really&quot;&gt;GitOps&lt;/a&gt; is an operating model for cloud native technologies, providing a set of best practices that unify deployment, management and monitoring for applications (originally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request&quot;&gt;coined&lt;/a&gt; by Alexis Richardson from Weaveworks fame). The most important aspect of GitOps is describing the desired system state versioned in Git via a declaration fashion, that essentially enables a complex set of system changes to be applied correctly and then verified (via a nice audit log enabled via Git and other tools). From a pragmatic standpoint, GitOps improves developer experience and with the growth of projects like Argo, GitLab, Flux and so on, I expect GitOps tools to hit the enterprise more this year. If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/07/14/gitops-next-big-thing-automation/&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from say GitLab, GitOps is still a nascent practice where the majority of companies haven’t explored it yet but as more companies move to adopt cloud native software at scale, GitOps will naturally follow in my opinion. If you’re interested in learning more about this space, I recommend checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefresh.io/devops/announcing-gitops-working-group/&quot;&gt;newly&lt;/a&gt; formed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group&quot;&gt;GitOps Working Group&lt;/a&gt; in CNCF.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Catalogs 2.0: Cloud Native Developer Dashboards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concept of a service catalog isn’t a new thing, for some of us older folks that grew up in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL&quot;&gt;ITIL&lt;/a&gt; era you may remember things such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management_database&quot;&gt;CMDBs&lt;/a&gt; (the horror). However, with the rise of microservices and cloud native development, the ability to catalog services and index a variety of real time service metadata is paramount to drive developer automation. This can include using a service catalog to understand ownership to handle incident management, manage SLOs and more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the future, you will see a trend towards developer dashboards that are not only a service catalog, but provide an ability to extend the dashboard through a variety of automation features all in one place. The canonical open source examples of this are &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/03/17/what-the-heck-is-backstage-anyway/&quot;&gt;Backstage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.lyft.com/announcing-clutch-the-open-source-platform-for-infrastructure-tooling-143d00de9713&quot;&gt;Clutch&lt;/a&gt; from Lyft, however, any company with a fairly modern cloud native deployment tends to have a platform infrastructure team that has tried to build something similar. As the open source developer dashboards mature with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://backstage.io/plugins&quot;&gt;large plug-in ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see accelerated adoption by platform engineering teams everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross Cloud Becomes More Real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes and the cloud native movement have demonstrated that cloud native and multi cloud approaches are possible in production environments, the data is clear that “93% of enterprises have a strategy to use multiple providers like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://info.flexera.com/SLO-CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud-2020&quot;&gt;State of the Cloud Report 2020&lt;/a&gt;). The fact that Kubernetes has matured over the years along with the cloud market, will hopefully unlock programmatic cross-cloud managed services. A concrete example of this approach is embodied in the Crossplane project that provides an open source cross cloud control plane taking advantage of the Kubernetes API extensibility to enable cross cloud workload management (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/gitlab-deploys-the-crossplane-control-plane-to-offer-multicloud-deployments/&quot;&gt;“GitLab Deploys the Crossplane Control Plane to Offer Multicloud Deployments”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mainstream eBPF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter&quot;&gt;eBPF&lt;/a&gt; allows you to run programs in the Linux Kernel without changing the kernel code or loading a module, you can think of it as a sandboxed extension mechanism. eBPF has allowed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebpf.io/projects&quot;&gt;new generation of software&lt;/a&gt; to extend the behavior of the Linux kernel to support a variety of different things from improved networking, monitoring and security. The downside of eBPF historically is that it requires a modern kernel version to take advantage of it and for a long time, that just wasn’t a realistic option for many companies. However, things are changing and even newer versions of RHEL finally support eBPF so you will see more projects take &lt;a href=&quot;https://sysdig.com/blog/sysdig-and-falco-now-powered-by-ebpf/&quot;&gt;advantage&lt;/a&gt;. If you look at the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://sysdig.com/blog/sysdig-2021-container-security-usage-report/&quot;&gt;container report&lt;/a&gt; from Sysdig, you can see the adoption of Falco rising recently which although the report may be a bit biased from Sysdig, it is reflected in production usage. So stay tuned and look for more eBPF based projects in the future!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, Happy 2021!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have a few more predictions and trends to share especially around end user driven open source, service mesh cannibalization/standardization, Prometheus+OTel, KYC for securing the software supply chain and more but I’ll save that for more detailed posts, nine predictions are enough to kick off the new year! Anyways, thanks for reading and I hope to see everyone at &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/&quot;&gt;KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU&lt;/a&gt; in May 2021, registration is open!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>DSL Forge: DSL Forge, dead or (still) alive?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dslforge.org/?p=1556</guid>
	<link>https://dslforge.org/dsl-forge-dead-or-still-alive/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a long time since the last post I’ve published on the DSL Forge blog. As the initial release back in 2014 and the “hot” context of that time, water has flowed under the bridges. The last couple of years, a lot of effort has been spent on the Coding Park platform, a commercial product based on DSL Forge. Unfortunately, not all the developments made since then have been integrated into the open-source repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve finally managed to have some time to clean the repository and fix some bugs, hence it’s up-to-date now, and still available under the EPL licence on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plugbee/dslforge&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why the project has not progressed the way we wanted at the beginning, let’s take a step back and think about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lack of ambition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why the adoption of cloud-based tools has not taken off is the standstill, and sometimes the lack of ambition, of top managers in big industry corporations who traditionnally use Eclipse technologies to build their internal products. Many companies have a huge legacy desktop applications built on top of Elipse RCP. Despite the acceleration that was put the last 5 years to encourage organizations to move to the web&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;cloud, eventually, very few have taken action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No standard cloud IDE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason is the absence of a “standard” platform which is unanimously supported to build new tools on top of it. Of course, there are some nice cloud IDEs flourishing under the Eclipse foundation umbrella, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dirigible.io/&quot;&gt;Dirigible &lt;/a&gt;(SAP), &lt;a href=&quot;https://theia-ide.org/&quot;&gt;Theia &lt;/a&gt;(TypeFox), or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/che/&quot;&gt;Che &lt;/a&gt;(Codenvy then Red Hat), but it’s still unclear for customers which of these is the winning horse. Today, Theia seems more accurate than its competitors if you judge based on the number of contributors, and the big tech companies that push the technology forward such as IBM, SAP, and Red Hat just to name a few of them. However, the frontier between these cloud IDEs is still confusing: Theia uses the workspace component of Che, later Theia has become the official UI of Che. Theia is somehow based on VS Code, but then has its own extension mechanism, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LSP or !LSP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there have been attempts to standardize the client/server exchange protocol in the case of text editing, with the Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/&quot;&gt;Language Server Protocol &lt;/a&gt;(LSP), and later with a variant of LSP to support graphical editing (GLSP). Pushing standards is a common strategy to make stakeholders in a given market collaborate in order to optimize their investments, however, like any other standard-focused community, there is a difference between theory and practice. Achieving a complete interoperability is quite unrealistic, because developing the editor front-end requires a lot of effort already, and even with the LSP in mind, it is common to end up developing the same functionality specifically for each editor, which is not always the top priority of commercial projects or startups willing to reduce their time-to-market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The cost of migration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said earlier, there is a large amount of legacy source code built on Eclipse RCP. The sustainability of this code is of strategic importance for many corporations, and unfortunately, most of it is written in Java and relies on SWT. Migrating this code is expensive as it implies rewriting a big part of it in JavaScript, with a particular technical stack/framework in mind, so it’s a long journey, architects have a lot of technical decisions to take along the way, and there is no garantee that they took the right decisions on the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The decline of the Eclipse IDE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends of Eclipse, don’t be upset! Having worked with a lot of junior developers in the last 5 years, I have noticed the Eclipse IDE is no longer of interest to many of them. A few years ago, Eclipse was best known for being a good Java IDE, back in the times when IBM was a driving force in the community. Today, the situation is different; Microsoft’s VS Code has established itself as the code editor of choice. It is still incomprehensible to see the poor performance of the Eclipse IDE, especially at startup. It is urgent that one of the cloud IDEs mentioned above take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The high volatility of web technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see new frameworks and new trends in web development technologies every day. For instance, the RIA frameworks appeared in the early 2010s finally had a short life, especially with the rise of the new frameworks such as React and Angular. Sever-side rendering is now part of History. One consequence of this was the slow down of investments in RIA-based frameworks, including the Eclipse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/rap/&quot;&gt;Remote Application Platform&lt;/a&gt; (RAP). Today, RAP is still under maintenance, however its scalability is questionable and its rendering capabilities look outdated compared to newer web frameworks. The incredible pace in which web technologies evolve is one of the factors that make decision makers hesitate to invest in cloud-based modeling tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The end of a cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a large part of legacy code must be rewritten in JavaScript or any of its variants (TypeScript, JSX, …), many historical developers (today’s senior developers) with a background in Java, have found themselves overwhelmed by the rise of new paradigms coming from the culture of web development. In legacy desktop applications, it is common to see the UI code, should it be in SWT or Swing, melted with the business logic. Of course, architects have always tried to separate the concerns as much as possible, but the same paradigm, structures, and programming language are used everywhere. With the new web frameworks, the learning curve is so steep that senior developers struggle to get hands on the new paradigms and coding style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EMF &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; JSON&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 10 years, EMF has become an industry-proven standard for model persistency, however it is quite unknown in the web development community. The most widely used format in data exchange through the web is JSON, and even though the facilities that come with EMF are advanced compared to the tooling support of JSON, the reality is, achieving complete bidirectionnality between EMF and JSON is not always garanteed. That beeing said, EclipseSource are doing a great job in this area thanks their work on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/emfcloud/&quot;&gt;EMF.cloud&lt;/a&gt; framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where is DSL Forge in all of this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DSL Forge project will continue to exist as long as it serves users. First, because the tool is still used in academic research. With a variety of legacy R&amp;amp;D prototypes built on RCP, it is easy to have quickly a web-based client thanks to the port of the SWT library on the web which does almost 90% of the job. Moreover, the framework is still used in commercial products, particularly in the field of Cybersecurity and Education. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codingpark.io&quot;&gt;Coding Park&lt;/a&gt; platform, initially developed on Eclipse RAP is still marketed under this technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, the DSL Forge was seen as a port of Xtext to the web that relies on ACE editor; this is half true as it has also a nice ANTLR/ACE integration. The tool released in 2014 was ahead of its time. Companies were not ready to make the leap (a lot are still in this situation now even with all the progress made), the demand was not mature enough, and the small number of contributors was a barrier to adoption. Given all of that, we made our own path outside the software development tools market. Meanwhile, the former colleagues of Itemis (now at TypeFox) did a really good job: not only they have built a flawless cloud IDE, but also they have managed to forge strategic partnerships which are contributing to the success of Theia. Best of luck for Theia and the incredible team of TypeFox!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To conclude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugbee.com&quot;&gt;Plugbee&lt;/a&gt; is still supporting the maintenance of DSL Forge to guarantee the sustainability of customer products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, if you are looking to support a more modern technical stack, your best bet is to start with the Xtext servlet. For example, we have integrated the servlet into a Spring Boot/React application, and it works like a charm. The only effort we have made to achieve the integration was to bind properly the Xtext services to ACE editor. This effort has been made as part of the new release of Coding Park. The code will be extracted and made publicly available on the DSL Forge repository soon. If you are interested in this kind of integrations, feel free to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Fabio Zadrozny: LiClipse 7.1.0 released (improved Dark theme, LiClipseText and PyDev updates)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to announce that &lt;b&gt;LiClipse 7.1.0&lt;/b&gt; is now available for download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LiClipse is now based on &lt;b&gt;Eclipse 4.17 (2020-09)&lt;/b&gt;,

	<title>Christopher Guindon: ECA Validation Update for Gerrit</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chrisguindon.com/post/eca-validation-update-gerrit/</guid>
	<link>https://www.chrisguindon.com/post/eca-validation-update-gerrit/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We are planning to install a new version of our Gerrit ECA validation plugin this week in an effort to reduce errors when a contribution is validated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this update, we are moving our validation logic to our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/git-eca-rest-api&quot;&gt;ECA Validation API&lt;/a&gt; that we created for our new Gitlab instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are planning to push these changes live on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, December 9 at 16:00 GMT&lt;/strong&gt;, though there is no planned downtime associated with this update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan is to revert back to a previous version of the plugin if we detect any anomalies after deploying this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that we are also planning to apply these changes to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apps/eclipse-eca-validation&quot;&gt;GitHub ECA validation app&lt;/a&gt; in Q1 of 2021. You can expect more news about this in the new year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested, the code for the API and the plugin are open-source and can be seen at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/git-eca-rest-api&quot;&gt;git-eca-rest-api&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/gerrit-eca-plugin&quot;&gt;gerrit-eca-plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use our GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/gerrit-eca-plugin/issues/24&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; to discuss any concerns you might have with this change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Christopher Guindon: Become an Eclipse Technology Adopter</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.chrisguindon.com/post/adopters-eclipse-technology/</guid>
	<link>https://www.chrisguindon.com/post/adopters-eclipse-technology/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you know that organizations — whether they are members of the Eclipse Foundation or not — can be listed as Eclipse technology adopters?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2019, The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/&quot;&gt;Eclipse IoT&lt;/a&gt; working group launched a campaign to promote &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/&quot;&gt;adopters&lt;/a&gt; of Eclipse IoT technologies. Since then, more than 60 organizations have shown their support to various Eclipse IoT projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that success in mind, we decided to build a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-project-adopters&quot;&gt;API service&lt;/a&gt; responsible for managing adopters for all our projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If needed, this new service will allow us to create an Adopters page for each of our working groups. This is something that we are currently working on for &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecdtools.eclipse.org/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Cloud Development Tools&lt;/a&gt;. Organizations that wishes to be listed on this new page can submit their request today by following our &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/chrisguindon/eclipse#how-can-my-organization-be-listed-as-adoptor-of-eclipse-technology&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, every Eclipse project can now leverage our JavaScript plugin to display logos of adopters without committing them in their website git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, you can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Ditto&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-changing&quot;&gt;What Is Changing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are migrating logos and related metadata to a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-project-adopters&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;. This means that adopters of Eclipse IoT technologies will be asked to submit their request to this new repository. This change is expected to occur on &lt;strong&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan on updating our documentation to point new users to this new repository. If an issue is created in the wrong repository, we will simply move them to the right location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is very similar with this new repository but we did make some improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path where we store logos is changing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file format is changing from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/iot.eclipse.org/blob/master/data/adopters.yml&quot;&gt;.yml&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-project-adopters/blob/master/config/adopters.json&quot;&gt;.json&lt;/a&gt; to reduce user errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The structure of the file was modified to make it easier for an organization to adopt multiple projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect this change to go uninterrupted to our users. The content of the Eclipse IoT &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/&quot;&gt;Adopters&lt;/a&gt; page won’t change and the JavaScript widget hosted on iot.eclipse.org will continue to work as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please create an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-project-adopters/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions or concerns regarding this migreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-my-organization-be-listed-as-adoptor-of-eclipse-technology&quot;&gt;How Can My Organization be Listed as Adoptor of Eclipse Technology?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preferred way to become an adopter is with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-project-adopters/pulls&quot;&gt;pull-request&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;strong&gt;colored&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;white&lt;/strong&gt; organization logo to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-project-adopters/tree/master/static/assets/images/adopters&quot;&gt;static/assets/images/adoptors&lt;/a&gt;. We expect logos to be submitted as .svg and they must be transparent. The file size should be less than 20kb since we are planning to use them for the web!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the adopter JSON file: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-project-adopters/blob/master/config/adopters.json&quot;&gt;config/adopters.json&lt;/a&gt;. Organizations can be easily marked as having multiple adopted projects across different working groups, no need to create separate entries for different projects or working groups!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative way to become an adopter is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EclipseFdn/eclipsefdn-project-adopters/issues/new?template=adopter_request.md&quot;&gt;submit an issue&lt;/a&gt; with your logo and the project name that your organization has adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-we-list-adopters-on-our-project-website&quot;&gt;How Can We List Adopters on Our Project Website?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built a JavaScript plugin to make this process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Include our plugin in your page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f92672;&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a6e22e;&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f92672;&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #e6db74;&quot;&gt;&quot;//api.eclipse.org/adopters/assets/js/eclipsefdn.adopters.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f92672;&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load the plugin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
eclipseFdnAdopters.getList({
project_id: &quot;[project_id]&quot;
});
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create an HTML element containing the chosen selector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;eclipsefdn-adopters&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, the selector’s value is &lt;code&gt;eclipsefdn-adopters&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;options&quot;&gt;Options&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
eclipseFdnAdopters.getList({
project_id: &quot;[project_id]&quot;,
selector: &quot;.eclipsefdn-adopters&quot;,
ul_classes: &quot;list-inline&quot;,
logo_white: false
});
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Attribute&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Default&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;project_id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;String&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required&lt;/strong&gt;: Select adopters from a specific project ID.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;selector&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;String&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;.eclipsefdn-adopters&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Define the selector that the plugin will insert adopters into.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;ul_classes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;String&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Define classes that will be assigned to the ul element.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;logo_white&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boolean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Whether or not we use the white version of the logo.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

	<title>Christian Pontesegger: Add Checkstyle support to Eclipse, Maven, and Jenkins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3460102793186140898.post-5782275551340885799</guid>
	<link>http://codeandme.blogspot.com/2020/12/add-checkstyle-support-to-eclipse-maven.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;http://codeandme.blogspot.com/2020/11/add-pmd-support-to-eclipse-and-maven.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://codeandme.blogspot.com/2020/11/add-spotbugs-support-to-eclipse-maven.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SpotBugs&lt;/a&gt; we will have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://checkstyle.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Checkstyle&lt;/a&gt; integration into the IDE and our maven builds. Parts of this tutorial are already covered by Lars' tutorial on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Checkstyle/article.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Using the Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 1: Add Eclipse IDE Support&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/#!/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Checkstyle Plugin&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/checkstyle-plug&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Marketplace.&lt;/a&gt; Before we enable the checker, we need to define a ruleset to run against. As in the previous tutorials, we will setup project specific rules backed by one ruleset that can also be used by maven later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a new file for your rules in &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;yourProject&amp;gt;.releng/checkstyle/checkstyle_rules.xml&lt;/i&gt;. If you are familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;writing rules&lt;/a&gt; just add them. In case you are new, you might want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/tree/master/src/main/resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;start with one of the default rulesets&lt;/a&gt; of checkstyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we have some rules, we need to add them to our projects. Therefore right click on a project and select &lt;i&gt;Checkstyle/Activate Checkstyle&lt;/i&gt;. This will add the project nature and a builder. To make use of our common ruleset, create a file &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;project&amp;gt;/.checkstyle&lt;/i&gt; with following content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;fileset-config file-format-version=&quot;1.2.0&quot; simple-config=&quot;false&quot; sync-formatter=&quot;false&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;local-check-config name=&quot;Skills Checkstyle&quot; location=&quot;/yourProject.releng/checkstyle/checkstyle_rules.xml&quot; type=&quot;project&quot; description=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;additional-data name=&quot;protect-config-file&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;/local-check-config&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;fileset name=&quot;All files&quot; enabled=&quot;true&quot; check-config-name=&quot;Skills Checkstyle&quot; local=&quot;true&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;file-match-pattern match-pattern=&quot;.java$&quot; include-pattern=&quot;true&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;/fileset&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/fileset-config&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to adapt the &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;location&lt;/i&gt; attributes of &lt;i&gt;local-check-config&lt;/i&gt; according to your project structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checkstyle will now run automatically on builds or can be triggered manually via the context menu: &lt;i&gt;Checkstyle/Check Code with Checkstyle&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 2: Modifying Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we had to do our setup manually, we can now use the UI integration to adapt our rules. Select the &lt;i&gt;Properties&lt;/i&gt; context entry from a project and navigate to &lt;i&gt;Checkstyle&lt;/i&gt;, page &lt;i&gt;Local Check Configurations&lt;/i&gt;. There select your ruleset and click &lt;i&gt;Configure...&lt;/i&gt; The following dialog allows to add/remove rules and to change rule properties. All your changes are backed by our &lt;i&gt;checkstyle_rules.xml&lt;/i&gt; file we created earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 3: Maven Integration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maven Checkstyle Plugin&lt;/a&gt; to our build. Therefore add following section to your master pom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;	&amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;maven.checkstyle.version&amp;gt;3.1.1&amp;lt;/maven.checkstyle.version&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&amp;lt;build&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;!-- enable checkstyle code analysis --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;maven-checkstyle-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${maven.checkstyle.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;configLocation&amp;gt;../../releng/yourProject.releng/checkstyle/checkstyle_rules.xml&amp;lt;/configLocation&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;linkXRef&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/linkXRef&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;checkstyle-integration&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;phase&amp;gt;verify&amp;lt;/phase&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;							&amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;check&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;/plugins&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&amp;lt;/build&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;configuration&lt;/i&gt; we address the ruleset we also use for the IDE plugin. Make sure that the relative path fits to your project setup. In the provided setup execution is bound to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;verify phase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 4: File Exclusions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding files has to be handled differently for IDE and Maven. The Eclipse plugin allows to define inclusions and exclusions via &lt;i&gt;file-match-pattern&lt;/i&gt; entries in the &lt;i&gt;.checkstyle&lt;/i&gt; configuration file. To exclude a certain package use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;  &amp;lt;fileset name=&quot;All files&quot; enabled=&quot;true&quot; check-config-name=&quot;Skills Checkstyle&quot; local=&quot;true&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    ...&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;file-match-pattern match-pattern=&quot;org.yourproject.generated.package.*$&quot; include-pattern=&quot;false&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;/fileset&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In maven we need to add exclusions via the plugin &lt;i&gt;configuration&lt;/i&gt; section. Typically such exclusions would go to the pom of a specific project and not the master pom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;	&amp;lt;build&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;!-- remove generated resources from checkstyle code analysis --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;maven-checkstyle-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${maven.checkstyle.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;excludes&amp;gt;**/org/yourproject/generated/package/**/*&amp;lt;/excludes&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;/plugins&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&amp;lt;/build&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 5: Jenkins Integration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you followed my previous tutorials on code checkers, then this is business as usual: use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;warnings-ng plugin&lt;/a&gt; on Jenkins to track our findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;	recordIssues tools: [checkStyle()]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.eclipse.org/skills/job/skills.build.nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/analysis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Try out the live chart&lt;/a&gt; on the skills project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Christian Pontesegger: Add SpotBugs support to Eclipse, Maven, and Jenkins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3460102793186140898.post-9036099346823303680</guid>
	<link>http://codeandme.blogspot.com/2020/11/add-spotbugs-support-to-eclipse-maven.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spotbugs.github.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SpotBugs&lt;/a&gt; (successor of FindBugs) is a tool for static code analysis, similar like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmd.github.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PMD&lt;/a&gt;. Both tools help to detect bad code constructs which might need improvement. As they partly detect different issues, they may be well combined and used simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 1: Add Eclipse IDE Support&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eclipse.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SpotBugs Eclipse Plugin&lt;/a&gt; can be installed directly via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spotbugs-eclipse-plugin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After installation projects can be configured to use it from the projects &lt;i&gt;Properties&lt;/i&gt; context menu. Navigate to the &lt;i&gt;SpotBugs&lt;/i&gt; category and enable all checkboxes on the main site. Further set &lt;i&gt;Minimum rank to report&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;20&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Minimum confidence to report&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Low&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcQIzmnpVTA/X7zjp_5T-rI/AAAAAAAABWQ/O7phV2Syst0BM0oTDvchOpCeKDgV2lbpACLcBGAsYHQ/s908/SpotBugs_prefs.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcQIzmnpVTA/X7zjp_5T-rI/AAAAAAAABWQ/O7phV2Syst0BM0oTDvchOpCeKDgV2lbpACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h288/SpotBugs_prefs.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once done SpotBugs immediately scans the project for problems. Found issues are displayed as custom markers in editors. Further they are visible in the &lt;i&gt;Bug Explorer&lt;/i&gt; view as well as in the &lt;i&gt;Problems&lt;/i&gt; view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SpotBugs also comes with a label decoration on elements in the &lt;i&gt;Package Explorer&lt;/i&gt;. If you do not like these then disable all &lt;i&gt;Bug count decorator&lt;/i&gt; entries in &lt;i&gt;Preferences/General/Appearance/Label Decorations&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 2: Maven Integration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration is done via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotbugs.github.io/spotbugs-maven-plugin/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SpotBugs Maven Plugin&lt;/a&gt;. To enable, add following section to your master pom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;	&amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;maven.spotbugs.version&amp;gt;4.1.4&amp;lt;/maven.spotbugs.version&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&amp;lt;build&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;!-- enable spotbugs code analysis --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;com.github.spotbugs&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;spotbugs-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${maven.spotbugs.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;effort&amp;gt;Max&amp;lt;/effort&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;threshold&amp;gt;Low&amp;lt;/threshold&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;fork&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/fork&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;spotbugs-integration&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;phase&amp;gt;verify&amp;lt;/phase&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;							&amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;spotbugs&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;/plugins&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&amp;lt;/build&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The execution entry takes care that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotbugs.github.io/spotbugs-maven-plugin/spotbugs-mojo.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spotbugs goal&lt;/a&gt; is automatically executed during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;verify phase&lt;/a&gt;. If you remove the execution section you would have to call the &lt;i&gt;spotbugs&lt;/i&gt; goal separately:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;mvn spotbugs:spotbugs&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 3: File Exclusions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might have code that you do not want to get checked (eg generated files). Exclusions need to be defined in an xml file. A simple filter on package level looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;FindBugsFilter&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;!-- skip EMF generated packages --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;Match&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;Package name=&quot;~org\.eclipse\.skills\.model.*&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/Match&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/FindBugsFilter&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the documentation for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/filter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;full description of filter definitions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once defined this file can be used from the SpotBugs Eclipse plugin as well as from the maven setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To simplify the maven configuration we can add following profile to our master pom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;	&amp;lt;profiles&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;profile&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;!-- apply filter when filter file exists --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;auto-spotbugs-exclude&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;activation&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;file&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;exists&amp;gt;.settings/spotbugs-exclude.xml&amp;lt;/exists&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;/file&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;/activation&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;build&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;!-- enable spotbugs exclude filter --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;com.github.spotbugs&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;spotbugs-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${maven.spotbugs.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;							&amp;lt;excludeFilterFile&amp;gt;.settings/spotbugs-exclude.xml&amp;lt;/excludeFilterFile&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;						&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;					&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;				&amp;lt;/plugins&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;			&amp;lt;/build&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;		&amp;lt;/profile&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;	&amp;lt;/profiles&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gets automatically enabled when a file &lt;i&gt;.settings/spotbugs-exclude.xml&lt;/i&gt; exists in the current project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 4: Jenkins Integration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codeandme.blogspot.com/2020/11/add-pmd-support-to-eclipse-and-maven.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Like with PMD&lt;/a&gt;, we again use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;warnings-ng plugin&lt;/a&gt; on Jenkins to track our findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml&quot;&gt;	recordIssues tools: [spotBugs(useRankAsPriority: true)]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.eclipse.org/skills/job/skills.build.nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/analysis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Try out the live chart&lt;/a&gt; on the skills project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PMD is smoother on integration as it stores its rulesets in a common file which can be shared by maven and the Eclipse plugin. SpotBugs currently requires to manage rulesets separately. Still both can be implemented in a way that users automatically get the same warnings in maven and the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Andrey Loskutov: My main update site moved</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-342159971341432126.post-6825036994081795354</guid>
	<link>http://javaclipse.blogspot.com/2020/11/my-main-update-site-moved.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;My host provider GMX decided that free hosting that they offered for over a decade is not fitting to their portfolio  anymore (for some security reasons) and simply switched my &lt;b&gt;andrei.gmxhome.de&lt;/b&gt; domain off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #515151; font-family: RobotoReg, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;... aus Sicherheitsgründen modernisieren wir regelmäßig unser Produktportfolio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #515151; font-family: RobotoReg, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #515151; font-family: RobotoReg, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;Im Zuge dessen möchten wir Sie darüber informieren, dass wir Ihren Webspace mit Ihrem Subdomain-Namen andrei.gmxhome.de zum 19‌.11‌.20‌20 kündigen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of that, Eclipse update site for all my plugins is moved now: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrei.gmxhome.de/eclipse/&quot;&gt;http://andrei.gmxhome.de/eclipse/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;to &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iloveeclipse/plugins/latest/&quot;&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iloveeclipse/plugins/latest/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same way, my &quot;home&quot; is moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/iloveeclipse/plugins/wiki&quot;&gt;https://github.com/iloveeclipse/plugins/wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Github obviously has no issues with free hosting).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means, anyone who used to have my main update site in scripts / Oomph setups, has to change them to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iloveeclipse/plugins/latest/&quot;&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iloveeclipse/plugins/latest/&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry for that, but that is nothing I could change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Rohan Kumar: What’s new in Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client 4.12.0</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://developers.redhat.com/blog/?p=796677</guid>
	<link>https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/10/30/whats-new-in-fabric8-kubernetes-java-client-4-12-0/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/releases/tag/v4.12.0&quot;&gt;4.12.0&lt;/a&gt; release includes many new features and bug fixes. This article introduces the major features we’ve added between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/releases/tag/v4.11.0&quot;&gt;4.11.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/releases/tag/v4.12.0&quot;&gt;4.12.0&lt;/a&gt; releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show you how to get started with the new &lt;code&gt;VolumeSnapshot&lt;/code&gt; extension, &lt;code&gt;CertificateSigningRequests&lt;/code&gt;, and Tekton triggers in the Fabric8 Tekton client (to name just a few). I’ll also point out several minor changes that break backward compatibility with older releases. Knowing about these changes will help you avoid problems when you upgrade to the latest version of Fabric8’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/topics/enterprise-java/&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; client for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/topics/kubernetes&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview&quot;&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to get the new Fabric8 Java client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find the most current Fabric8 Java client release on &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.fabric8/kubernetes-client/4.12.0/jar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt;. To start using the new Java client, add it as a dependency in your Maven &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;. For Kubernetes, the dependency is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;io.fabric8&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;kubernetes-client&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;4.12.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For OpenShift, it’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;io.fabric8&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;openshift-client&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;4.12.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking changes in this release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have moved several classes for this release, so upgrading to the new version of the Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client might not be completely smooth. The changes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We moved the &lt;code&gt;CustomResourceDefinition&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.apiextensions.v1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.apiextensions.v1beta1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We moved &lt;code&gt;SubjectAccessReview&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SelfSubjectAccessReview&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LocalSubjectAccessReview&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SelfSubjectRulesReview&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.authorization.v1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.authorization.v1beta1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;io.fabric8.tekton.pipeline.v1beta1.WorkspacePipelineDeclaration&lt;/code&gt; is now &lt;code&gt;io.fabric8.tekton.pipeline.v1beta1.PipelineWorkspaceDeclaration&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We introduced a new interface, &lt;code&gt;WatchAndWaitable&lt;/code&gt;, which is used by &lt;code&gt;WatchListDeletable&lt;/code&gt; and other interfaces. This change should not affect you if you are using the Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://javadoc.io/doc/io.fabric8/kubernetes-client/latest/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;domain-specific language (DSL)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The new VolumeSnapshot extension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might know about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/tree/master/extensions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client extensions&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/topics/serverless-architecture&quot;&gt;Knative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/topics/ci-cd&quot;&gt;Tekton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/topics/service-mesh&quot;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt;, and Service Catalog. In this release, we’ve added a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Container Storage Interface&lt;/a&gt; (CSI) &lt;code&gt;VolumeSnapshot&lt;/code&gt; extension. &lt;code&gt;VolumeSnapshot&lt;/code&gt;s are in the &lt;code&gt;snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1&lt;/code&gt; directory. To start using the new extension, add the following dependency to your Maven &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;io.fabric8&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;volumesnapshot-client&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;4.12.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve added the dependency, you can start using the &lt;code&gt;VolumeSnapshotClient&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s an example of how to create a &lt;code&gt;VolumeSnapshot&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (VolumeSnapshotClient client = new DefaultVolumeSnapshotClient()) {
      System.out.println(&quot;Creating a volume snapshot&quot;);
      client.volumeSnapshots().inNamespace(&quot;default&quot;).createNew()
        .withNewMetadata()
        .withName(&quot;my-snapshot&quot;)
        .endMetadata()
        .withNewSpec()
        .withNewSource()
        .withNewPersistentVolumeClaimName(&quot;my-pvc&quot;)
        .endSource()
        .endSpec()
        .done();
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spin up a single pod with &lt;code&gt;client.run()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like you would with &lt;code&gt;kubectl run&lt;/code&gt;, you can quickly spin up a pod with the Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client. You only need to provide a name and image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (KubernetesClient client = new DefaultKubernetesClient()) {
    client.run().inNamespace(&quot;default&quot;).withName(&quot;hello-openshift&quot;)
            .withImage(&quot;openshift/hello-openshift:latest&quot;)
            .done();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authentication API support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new authentication API lets you use the Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client to query a Kubernetes cluster. You should be able to use the API for all operations equivalent to &lt;code&gt;kubectl auth can-i&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (KubernetesClient client = new DefaultKubernetesClient()) {
    SelfSubjectAccessReview ssar = new SelfSubjectAccessReviewBuilder()
            .withNewSpec()
            .withNewResourceAttributes()
            .withGroup(&quot;apps&quot;)
            .withResource(&quot;deployments&quot;)
            .withVerb(&quot;create&quot;)
            .withNamespace(&quot;dev&quot;)
            .endResourceAttributes()
            .endSpec()
            .build();

    ssar = client.authorization().v1().selfSubjectAccessReview().create(ssar);

    System.out.println(&quot;Allowed: &quot;+  ssar.getStatus().getAllowed());
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OpenShift 4 resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client now supports all of the new OpenShift 4 resources in its OpenShift model. Additional resources added in &lt;code&gt;operators.coreos.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;operators.openshift.io&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;console.openshift.io&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;monitoring.coreos.com&lt;/code&gt; are also available within the OpenShift model. Here is an example of using &lt;code&gt;PrometheusRule&lt;/code&gt; to monitor a &lt;code&gt;Prometheus&lt;/code&gt; instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (OpenShiftClient client = new DefaultOpenShiftClient()) {
    PrometheusRule prometheusRule = new PrometheusRuleBuilder()
            .withNewMetadata().withName(&quot;foo&quot;).endMetadata()
            .withNewSpec()
            .addNewGroup()
            .withName(&quot;./example-rules&quot;)
            .addNewRule()
            .withAlert(&quot;ExampleAlert&quot;)
            .withNewExpr().withStrVal(&quot;vector(1)&quot;).endExpr()
            .endRule()
            .endGroup()
            .endSpec()
            .build();

    client.monitoring().prometheusRules().inNamespace(&quot;rokumar&quot;).createOrReplace(prometheusRule);
    System.out.println(&quot;Created&quot;);

    PrometheusRuleList prometheusRuleList = client.monitoring().prometheusRules().inNamespace(&quot;rokumar&quot;).list();
    System.out.println(prometheusRuleList.getItems().size() + &quot; items found&quot;);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Certificate signing requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve added a new entry point, &lt;code&gt;certificateSigningRequests()&lt;/code&gt;, in the main &lt;code&gt;KubernetesClient&lt;/code&gt; interface. This means you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CertificateSigningRequest resources&lt;/a&gt; in all of your applications developed with Fabric8:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (KubernetesClient client = new DefaultKubernetesClient()) {

    CertificateSigningRequest csr = new CertificateSigningRequestBuilder()
            .withNewMetadata().withName(&quot;test-k8s-csr&quot;).endMetadata()
            .withNewSpec()
            .addNewGroup(&quot;system:authenticated&quot;)
            .withRequest(&quot;&amp;lt;your-req&amp;gt;&quot;)
            .addNewUsage(&quot;client auth&quot;)
            .endSpec()
            .build();
    client.certificateSigningRequests().create(csr);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Custom resource definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve moved the &lt;code&gt;apiextensions/v1&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;CustomResourceDefinition&lt;/code&gt; (CRD) to the &lt;code&gt;io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.apiextensions.v1beta1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.apiextensions.v1&lt;/code&gt; packages. You can now use &lt;code&gt;CustomResourceDefinition&lt;/code&gt; objects inside &lt;code&gt;apiextensions()&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (KubernetesClient client = new DefaultKubernetesClient()) {
    client.apiextensions().v1()
            .customResourceDefinitions()
            .list()
            .getItems().forEach(crd -&amp;gt; System.out.println(crd.getMetadata().getName()));
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating bootstrap project templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve provided a new, built-in way to create a project with all of the role bindings you need. It works like OpenShift’s &lt;code&gt;oc adm create-bootstrap-project-template&lt;/code&gt; command. Specify the parameters that the template requires in the DSL method. The method then creates the &lt;code&gt;Project&lt;/code&gt; and related &lt;code&gt;RoleBindings&lt;/code&gt; for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (OpenShiftClient client = new DefaultOpenShiftClient()) {
    client.projects().createProjectAndRoleBindings(&quot;default&quot;, &quot;Rohan Kumar&quot;, &quot;default&quot;, &quot;developer&quot;, &quot;developer&quot;);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tekton model 0.15.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve updated the Tekton model to version 0.15.1 so that you can take advantage of all the newest upstream features and enhancements for Tekton. This example creates a simple &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TaskRun&lt;/code&gt; to echo “hello world” in a pod. Instead of &lt;code&gt;YAML&lt;/code&gt;, we use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.fabric8/tekton-client/4.12.0/bundle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fabric8 TektonClient&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (TektonClient tkn = new DefaultTektonClient()) {
    // Create Task
    tkn.v1beta1().tasks().inNamespace(NAMESPACE).createOrReplaceWithNew()
            .withNewMetadata().withName(&quot;echo-hello-world&quot;).endMetadata()
            .withNewSpec()
            .addNewStep()
            .withName(&quot;echo&quot;)
            .withImage(&quot;alpine:3.12&quot;)
            .withCommand(&quot;echo&quot;)
            .withArgs(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
            .endStep()
            .endSpec()
            .done();

    // Create TaskRun
    tkn.v1beta1().taskRuns().inNamespace(NAMESPACE).createOrReplaceWithNew()
            .withNewMetadata().withName(&quot;echo-hello-world-task-run&quot;).endMetadata()
            .withNewSpec()
            .withNewTaskRef()
            .withName(&quot;echo-hello-world&quot;)
            .endTaskRef()
            .endSpec()
            .done();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run this code, you will see the &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TaskRun&lt;/code&gt; being created. The &lt;code&gt;TaskRun&lt;/code&gt;, in turn, creates a pod, which prints the “Hello World” message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;tekton-java-client-demo : $ tkn taskrun list
NAME                        STARTED         DURATION     STATUS
echo-hello-world-task-run   2 minutes ago   19 seconds   Succeeded
tekton-java-client-demo : $ kubectl get pods
NAME                                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
echo-hello-world-task-run-pod-4gczw   0/1     Completed   0          2m17s
tekton-java-client-demo : $ kubectl logs pod/echo-hello-world-task-run-pod-4gczw
Hello World
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tekton triggers in the Fabric8 Tekton client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.fabric8/tekton-client/4.12.0/bundle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fabric8 Tekton client&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.fabric8/tekton-model-v1beta1/4.12.0/bundle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; now support &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tekton triggers&lt;/a&gt;. You can use triggers to automate the creation of Tekton pipelines. All you have to do is embed your triggers in the Tekton continuous deployment (CD) pipeline. Here is an example of using the Fabric8 Tekton client to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/3a2ecf8b3ef143a81d6908d055bef4f3251ed01d/examples/triggertemplates/triggertemplate.yaml#L1-L38&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tekton trigger template&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (TektonClient tkn = new DefaultTektonClient()) {
    tkn.v1alpha1().triggerTemplates().inNamespace(NAMESPACE).createOrReplaceWithNew()
            .withNewMetadata().withName(&quot;pipeline-template&quot;).endMetadata()
            .withNewSpec()
                .addNewParam()
                    .withName(&quot;gitrepositoryurl&quot;)
                    .withDescription(&quot;The git repository url&quot;)
                .endParam()
                .addNewParam()
                    .withName(&quot;gitrevision&quot;)
                    .withDescription(&quot;The git revision&quot;)
                .endParam()
                .addNewParam()
                    .withName(&quot;message&quot;)
                    .withDescription(&quot;The message to print&quot;)
                    .withDefault(&quot;This is default message&quot;)
                .endParam()
                .addNewParam()
                    .withName(&quot;contenttype&quot;)
                    .withDescription(&quot; The Content-Type of the event&quot;)
                .endParam()
            .withResourcetemplates(Collections.singletonList(new PipelineRunBuilder()
                    .withNewMetadata().withGenerateName(&quot;simple-pipeline-run-&quot;).endMetadata()
                    .withNewSpec()
                        .withNewPipelineRef().withName(&quot;simple-pipeline&quot;).endPipelineRef()
                        .addNewParam()
                            .withName(&quot;message&quot;)
                            .withValue(new ArrayOrString(&quot;$(tt.params.message)&quot;))
                        .endParam()
                        .addNewParam()
                            .withName(&quot;contenttype&quot;)
                            .withValue(new ArrayOrString(&quot;$(tt.params.contenttype)&quot;))
                        .endParam()
                        .addNewResource()
                            .withName(&quot;git-source&quot;)
                            .withNewResourceSpec()
                                .withType(&quot;git&quot;)
                                .addNewParam()
                                .withName(&quot;revision&quot;)
                                .withValue(&quot;$(tt.params.gitrevision)&quot;)
                                .endParam()
                                .addNewParam()
                                .withName(&quot;url&quot;)
                                .withValue(&quot;$(tt.params.gitrepositoryurl)&quot;)
                                .endParam()
                            .endResourceSpec()
                        .endResource()
                    .endSpec()
                    .build()))
            .endSpec()
            .done();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automatically refresh OpenID Connect tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your Kubernetes provider uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenID Connect tokens&lt;/a&gt; (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/cloud&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IBM Cloud&lt;/a&gt;), you don’t need to worry about your tokens expiring. The new Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client automatically refreshes your tokens by contacting the OpenID Connect provider, which is listed in the &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Support for Knative 0.17.2 and Knative Eventing Contrib&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this release, we’ve updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://knative.dev/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Knative&lt;/a&gt; model to the latest version. We also added new support for the additional resources from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Knative Eventing Contrib&lt;/a&gt;, which involves &lt;a href=&quot;https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sources/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; and channel implementations that integrate with Apache CouchDB, Apache Kafka, Amazon Simple Queue Service (AWS SQS), GitHub, GitLab, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of creating an &lt;code&gt;AwsSqsSource&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;KnativeClient&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;try (KnativeClient client = new DefaultKnativeClient()) {
    AwsSqsSource awsSqsSource = new AwsSqsSourceBuilder()
            .withNewMetadata().withName(&quot;awssqs-sample-source&quot;).endMetadata()
            .withNewSpec()
            .withNewAwsCredsSecret(&quot;credentials&quot;, &quot;aws-credentials&quot;, true)
            .withQueueUrl(&quot;QUEUE_URL&quot;)
            .withSink(new ObjectReferenceBuilder()
                    .withApiVersion(&quot;messaging.knative.dev/v1alpha1&quot;)
                    .withKind(&quot;Channel&quot;)
                    .withName(&quot;awssqs-test&quot;)
                    .build())
            .endSpec()
            .build();
    client.awsSqsSources().inNamespace(&quot;default&quot;).createOrReplace(awsSqsSource);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get involved!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to get involved with the development of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>itemis: Getting started with Eclipse GEF – the Mindmap Tutorial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://blogs.itemis.com/en/getting-started-with-eclipse-gef-the-mindmap-tutorial</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.itemis.com/en/getting-started-with-eclipse-gef-the-mindmap-tutorial</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/gef/&quot; title=&quot;Link to eclipse.org (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework&lt;/a&gt; is a toolkit to create graphical Java applications either integrated in Eclipse or standalone. The most common use of the framework is to develop diagram editors, like a simple Mindmap editor we will create in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://info.itemis.com/en/gef/tutorials/&quot; title=&quot;Link to GEF Online Tutorials (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;GEF Mindmap Tutorial series&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, the tutorial consists of 6 parts and all together 19 steps. They are structured as follows:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img alt=&quot;gef_mindmap_tutorial&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20(2020)/Getting%20started%20with%20Eclipse%20GEF%20%E2%80%93%20the%20Mindmap%20Tutorial/gef_mindmap_tutorial.png?width=960&amp;amp;name=gef_mindmap_tutorial.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 960px;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Part I – The Foundations&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 1: Preparing the development environment&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 2: Creating the model&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 3: Defining the visuals&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Part II – GEF MVC&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 4: Creating the GEF parts&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 5: Models, policies and behaviors&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 6: Moving and resizing a node&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Part III – Adding nodes and connections&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 7: Undo and redo operations&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 8: Creating new nodes&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 9: Creating connections&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Part IV – Modifying and removing nodes&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 10: Deleting nodes (1)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 11: Modifying nodes&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 12: Creating feedback&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 13: Deleting nodes (2)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Part V – Creating an Eclipse editor&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 14: Creating an Eclipse editor&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 15: Undo, redo, select all and delete in Eclipse&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 16: Contributing toolbar actions&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Part VI – Automatic layouting&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 17: Automatic layouting via GEF layout&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 18: Automatic layouting via Graphviz DOT&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Step 19: Automatic layouting via the Eclipse Layout Kernel&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

	<title>Nikhil Nanivadekar: Eclipse Collections 10.4.0 Released</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/7c5b3f43c0f0</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/oracledevs/eclipse-collections-10-4-0-released-7c5b3f43c0f0?source=rss-4285d8a2ca86------2</link>
	<description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RI7GnqLwdn-pic6lUm153A.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;View of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinnell_Glacier&quot;&gt;Grinnell Glacier&lt;/a&gt; from overlook point after a grueling 9 mile hike&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a release which we had not planned for, but we released it nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This must be the first time since we open sourced Eclipse Collections that we performed two releases within the same month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in Eclipse Collections 10.4.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only 2 changes in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/releases/tag/10.4.0&quot;&gt;10.4.0 release&lt;/a&gt; compared to the feature rich &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/oracledevs/eclipse-collections-10-3-released-1ee8ea3cf6e1&quot;&gt;10.3.0 release&lt;/a&gt; viz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added CharAdapter.isEmpty(), CodePointAdapter.isEmpty(), CodePointList.isEmpty(), as JDK-15 introduced CharSequence.isEmpty().&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed Javadoc errors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was release 10.4.0 necessary?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s rapid deployment world, it should not be a novel aspect that a project performs multiple releases. However, the Eclipse Collections maintainer team, performs releases when one or more of the below criteria are satisfied:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bulk of features are ready to be released&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A user requests a release for their use case&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JDK-EA compatibility is breaking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It has been more than 6 months that a version is released&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse Collections 10.4.0 release was necessary due to point #3. Eclipse Collections participates in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/quality/Quality+Outreach&quot;&gt;Quality Outreach&lt;/a&gt; program of Open JDK. As a part of this program the library is expected to test the Early Access (EA) versions of Java and identify potential issues in the library or the JDK. I had missed setting up the JDK-15-EA builds until after Eclipse Collections 10.3.0 was released. After setting up the JDK-15-EA builds on 16 August 2020, I found compiler issues in the library due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8215401&quot;&gt;isEmpty()&lt;/a&gt; added as a default method on CharSequence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stuartmarks&quot;&gt;Stuart Marks&lt;/a&gt; has written an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stuartmarks.wordpress.com/2020/09/22/incompatibilities-with-jdk-15-charsequence-isempty/&quot;&gt;in-depth blog&lt;/a&gt; of why this new default method broke compatibility. So, we had 2 options, let the library not be compatible with JDK-15, or release a new version with the fix. The Eclipse Collections team believes in supporting Java versions from Java 8 to Java-EA. After release 10.3.0, we had opened a new major version target (11.0.0), but the changes required did not warrant a new major version. So, we decided to release 10.4.0 with the fixes to support JDK-15. Eclipse Collections 10.4.0 release is compatible with JDK-15 and JDK-16-EA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Thank you&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the vibrant and supportive Eclipse Collections community on behalf of contributors, committers, and maintainers for using Eclipse Collections. We hope you enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/releases/tag/10.4.0&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections 10.4.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a Project Lead and Committer for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; OSS project at the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is open for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;contributions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Show your support, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/stargazers&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;star us on GitHub&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eclipse Collections Resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt; comes with it’s own implementations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/collections/javadoc/9.0.0/org/eclipse/collections/impl/list/mutable/FastList.html&quot;&gt;List&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/collections/javadoc/9.0.0/org/eclipse/collections/impl/set/mutable/UnifiedSet.html&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/collections/javadoc/9.0.0/org/eclipse/collections/impl/map/mutable/UnifiedMap.html&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/a&gt;.

	<title>Cedric Brun: Obeo's Chronicles, Autumn 2020</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://cedric.brun.io/eclipse/obeo-chronicles</guid>
	<link>https://cedric.brun.io/eclipse/obeo-chronicles/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe we are already looking at Q4. I have so much news to share with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eclipse-sirius-obeo-cloud-platform-and-sirius-web&quot;&gt;Eclipse Sirius, Obeo Cloud Platform and Sirius Web:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last summer we had the pleasure to organize SiriusCon. This one-day event is each year the opportunity for the modeling community to share their experience, and for the development team to provide visibility on what is currently being worked on and how we see the future of the technology. SiriusCon reached &lt;strong&gt;450 attendees&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;53 different countries&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to &lt;strong&gt;13 fabulous speakers&lt;/strong&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest edition was special to us, it used to be organized at the end of each year but we decided to postpone it for a few months to be ready for an announcement very close to our heart. We’ve been working on bringing on the Web what we love about Sirius for quite a few years already and reached a point where we have a promising product. Now is the time to accelerate, Mélanie Bats announced it during the conference: &lt;strong&gt;we are releasing “Sirius Web” as Open-Source and officially&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.obeo.fr/sirius-ii-mission&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;started the countdown&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/chronicles/siriuscon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/chronicles/siriuscon.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The announcement at SiriusCon 2020&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reactions to this announcement were fantastic with a lot of excitement within the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am myself very excited for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I expect this decision will, just like Sirius Desktop was released in Open-Source in 2013, &lt;strong&gt;a key factor leading to the creation of hundreds of graphical modelers&lt;/strong&gt;, in the same way currently demonstrated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/gallery.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sirius Gallery&lt;/a&gt; but now easily accessible through the Web and leveraging all the capabilities this platform brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our vision is to empower the tool specifier from the data structure and tool definition up to the deployment and exploitation of a modeling tool, &lt;strong&gt;directly from the browser, end to end and in an integrated and seamless way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not there yet, though as you’ll see the technology is already quite promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/chronicles/ocp.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/chronicles/ocp.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, for Obeo this decision strengthens our product-based business model while being faithful to our “open core” approach. &lt;strong&gt;We will offer, through Obeo Cloud Platform a Sirius Web build extended with Enterprise features&lt;/strong&gt;, to deploy on public, private clouds or on premise and including support and upgrade guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/chronicles/ocp-offer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/chronicles/ocp-offer.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Obeo Cloud Platform Offer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the announcement the team is working on Sirius Web to publish it as an Open-Source product so that you can start experimenting as soon as EclipseCon 2020. Mélanie will present this in detail during her talk: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/node/3210&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Sirius Web: 100% open source cloud modeling platform”&lt;/a&gt; ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;EclipseCon 2020&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hint: it’s still time to register for EclipseCon 2020 but do it quickly! The program committee did an excellent job in setting up an exciting program thanks to your many submissions, don’t miss it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capella-days-online-is-coming-up&quot;&gt;Capella Days Online is coming up!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not it! Each day we see Eclipse Capella get more and more adoption across the globe, this Open-Source product has its own 4-days event: Capella Days Online 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique occasion to get many experience reports from multiple domains: Space systems (CNES and GMV), Rail and transportation (Virgin Hyperloop, Nextrail and Vitesco technologies), healthcare (Siemens and Still AB), waste collecting with The SeaCleaners and all of that in addition to aerospace, defence and security with Thales Group. The program is packed with high-quality content: 12 sessions over 4 days from October 12th to 15th, more than 500 attendees already registered, join us and register!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Capella Days Program&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;smartea-60-supports-archimate-31-and-keeps-rising&quot;&gt;SmartEA 6.0 supports Archimate 3.1 and keeps rising!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use those open-source technologies, like Eclipse Sirius, Acceleo, EMF Compare, M2doc and many more in our “off the shelf” software solution for Enterprise Architecture: &lt;strong&gt;Obeo SmartEA&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.obeosmartea.com/en/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cedric.brun.io/images/blog/chronicles/smartea.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;SmartEA 6.0&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spring we released SmartEA 6.0, which got the Archimate 3.1 certification and brought among many other improvements: new modeling capabilities, extended user management, enhanced BPMN modeling and streamlined user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution is a challenger on the market and convinces more and more customers. &lt;em&gt;Stay tuned, I should be able to share a thrilling announcement soon!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;world-clean-up-day-and-the-seacleaners&quot;&gt;World Clean Up Day and The SeaCleaners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: an excellent dynamic on many fronts and exciting challenges ahead!
This is all made possible thanks to the energy and cohesion of the Obeo team in this weird, complex and unusual time. We are committed to the environment and to reduce plastic waste, as such we took part in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcleanupday.fr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Clean Up Day&lt;/a&gt;  in partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theseacleaners.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Sea Cleaners&lt;/a&gt; . Beyond the impact of this action which has so much sense to us, it was also a sharing and fun moment!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Nikhil Nanivadekar: MapIterable.getOrDefault() : New but not so new API</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/1fbf2c38a508</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/@nikhilnanivadekar/mapiterable-getordefault-new-but-not-so-new-api-1fbf2c38a508?source=rss-4285d8a2ca86------2</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;MapIterable.getOrDefault() : New but not so new API&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-BHnBBED8fcOaR9hl1hVLA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sunset at Port Hardy (June 2019)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Collections comes with it’s own List, Set, and Map implementations. These implementations extend the JDK List, Set, and Map implementations for easy interoperability. In Eclipse Collections 10.3.0, I introduced a new API MapIterable.getOrDefault(). In Java 8, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#getOrDefault(java.lang.Object,V)&quot;&gt;Map.getOrDefault()&lt;/a&gt; was introduced, so what makes it a new API for Eclipse Collections 10.3.0? Technically, it is new but not so new API! Consider the code snippets below, prior to Eclipse Collections 10.3.0:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LGa2c3g3lUQrySCraWm9Ew.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MutableMap&lt;/strong&gt;.getOrDefault() compiles and works fine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Dm8GxkyqNWByQ3dpB7MaOQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ImmutableMap&lt;/strong&gt;.getOrDefault() does not compile&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the code, MutableMap has getOrDefault() available, however ImmutableMap does not have it. But there is no reason why ImmutableMap should not have this read-only API. I found that MapIterable already had getIfAbsentValue() which has the same behavior. Then why did I still add getOrDefault() to MapIterable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I added MapIterable.getOrDefault() mainly for easy interoperability. Firstly, most Java developers will be aware of the getOrDefault() method, only Eclipse Collections users would be aware of getIfAbsentValue(). By providing the API same as the JDK it reduces the necessity to learn a new API. Secondly, even though getOrDefault() is available on MutableMap, it is not available on the highest Map interface of Eclipse Collections. Thirdly, I got to learn a Java compiler check which I had not experienced before. I will elaborate this check a bit more in detail because I find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I added getOrDefault() to MapIterable, various Map interfaces in Eclipse Collections started giving compiler errors with messages like: &lt;em&gt;org.eclipse.collections.api.map.MutableMapIterable inherits unrelated defaults for getOrDefault(Object, V) from types org.eclipse.collections.api.map.MapIterable and java.util.Map&lt;/em&gt;. This I thought was cool, because at compile time, the Java compiler is ensuring that if there is an API with default implementation in more than one interface in a multi-interface scenario, then Java will not decide which implementation to pick but rather throw compiler errors. Hence, Java ensures at compile time that there is no ambiguity regarding which implementation will be used at runtime. How awesome is that?!? In order to fix the compile time errors, I had to add a default implementations on the interfaces which gave the errors. I always believe in Compiler Errors are better than Runtime Exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stuartmarks&quot;&gt;Stuart Marks&lt;/a&gt; has put together an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stuartmarks.wordpress.com/2020/09/22/incompatibilities-with-jdk-15-charsequence-isempty/&quot;&gt;awesome blog&lt;/a&gt; which covers the specifics of such scenarios. I suggest reading that for in-depth understanding of how and why this behavior is observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post Eclipse Collections 10.3.0 the below code samples will work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZHp2pOKpKMgAlYdf97aLcw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MapIterable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.getOrDefault() compiles and works fine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MO5NLHLmkm7SlTdVYqc_Pg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MutableMap&lt;/strong&gt;.getOrDefault() compiles and works fine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-4uxJkMTp5NPT620jGzOhQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ImmutableMap&lt;/strong&gt;.getOrDefault() compiles and works fine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/releases/tag/10.3.0&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections 10.3.0&lt;/a&gt; was released on 08/08/2020 and is one of our most feature packed releases.

	<title>Rohan Kumar: Migrating from Fabric8 Maven Plugin to Eclipse JKube 1.0.0</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://developers.redhat.com/blog/?p=781287</guid>
	<link>https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/21/migrating-from-fabric8-maven-plugin-to-eclipse-jkube-1-0-0/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/09/cloud-native-java-applications-made-easy-eclipse-jkube-1-0-0-now-available/&quot;&gt;recent release of Eclipse JKube 1.0.0&lt;/a&gt; means that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fabric8 Maven Plugin&lt;/a&gt; is no longer supported. If you are currently using the Fabric8 Maven Plugin, this article provides instructions for migrating to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JKube&lt;/a&gt; instead. I will also explain the relationship between Eclipse JKube and the Fabric8 Maven Plugin (they’re the same thing) and introduce the highlights of the new Eclipse JKube 1.0.0 release. These migration instructions are for developers working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/topics/kubernetes&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview&quot;&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt; platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse JKube is the Fabric8 Maven Plugin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipse JKube and the Fabric8 Maven Plugin are one and the same. Eclipse JKube was first released in 2014 under the name of Fabric8 Maven Plugin. The development team changed the name when we pre-released Eclipse JKube 0.1.0 in December 2019. For more about the name change, see my recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/01/28/introduction-to-eclipse-jkube-java-tooling-for-kubernetes-and-red-hat-openshift/&quot;&gt;introduction to Eclipse JKube&lt;/a&gt;. This article focuses on the migration path to JKube 1.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-781287&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s new in Eclipse JKube 1.0.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are hesitant about migrating to JKube, the following highlights from the new 1.0.0 release might change your mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeted migration with the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.eclipse.jkube/kubernetes-maven-plugin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kubernetes Maven Plugin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:openshift-maven-plugin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenShift Maven Plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quay.io/organization/jkube&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Improved base images&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/articles/ubi-faq&quot;&gt;Red Hat Universal Base Images&lt;/a&gt; (UBI) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/topics/enterprise-java&quot;&gt;JDK 11&lt;/a&gt;. (Fabric8 Maven Plugin’s images are based on JDK 8.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No coupling to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fabric8.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fabric8.io&lt;/a&gt; platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source-to-Image (S2I) support for web applications and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/products/quarkus/getting-started&quot;&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/topics/containers&quot;&gt;containerizing&lt;/a&gt; your applications with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/docs/kubernetes-maven-plugin#_jib_java_image_builder&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JIB integration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/docs/kubernetes-maven-plugin#jkube:helm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Helm support&lt;/a&gt; in the Kubernetes Maven Plugin and OpenShift Maven Plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/jkube/tree/master/jkube-kit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JKube Kit&lt;/a&gt;, which is independent of both &lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradle.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/jkube/issues/66&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Podman and Buildah&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon in Eclipse JKube 1.1.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabric8 Maven Plugin generates both Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift artifacts, and it automatically detects and deploys resources to the underlying cluster. But developers who use Kubernetes don’t need OpenShift artifacts, and OpenShift developers don’t need Kubernetes manifests. We addressed this issue by splitting Fabric8 Maven Plugin into two plugins for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/jkube&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse JKube&lt;/a&gt;: Kubernetes Maven Plugin and OpenShift Maven Plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse JKube migration made easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipse JKube has a &lt;code&gt;migrate&lt;/code&gt; goal that automatically updates Fabric8 Maven Plugin references in your &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; to the Kubernetes Maven Plugin or OpenShift Maven Plugin. In the next sections, I’ll show you how to migrate a Fabric8 Maven Plugin-based project to either platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-Diagram.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Replace the code for the Fabric8 Maven plugin with either the code for the Kubernetes Maven plugin or the OpenShft Maven plugin.&quot; class=&quot; aligncenter  wp-image-781297 &quot; height=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-Diagram-1024x560.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For demonstration purposes, we can use my old random generator application, which displays a random JSON response at a &lt;code&gt;/random&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. To start, clone this repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/rohanKanojia/fmp-demo-project.git
cd fmp-demo-project
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then build the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ mvn clean install
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse JKube migration for Kubernetes users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the following goal to migrate to Eclipse JKube’s Kubernetes Maven Plugin. Note that we have to specify a complete &lt;code&gt;artifactId&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;groupId&lt;/code&gt; because the plugin is not automatically included in the &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ mvn org.eclipse.jkube:kubernetes-maven-plugin:migrate
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the logs for the &lt;code&gt;migrate&lt;/code&gt; goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;fmp-demo-project : $ mvn org.eclipse.jkube:kubernetes-maven-plugin:migrate
[INFO] Scanning for projects...

fmp-demo-project : $
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that all of the Fabric8 Maven Plugin references have been replaced by references to Eclipse JKube. The Kubernetes Maven Plugin is the same as the Fabric8 Maven Plugin. The only differences are the &lt;code&gt;k8s&lt;/code&gt; prefix and that it generates Kubernetes manifests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve installed the Kubernetes Maven Plugin, you can deploy your application as usual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ mvn k8s:build k8s:resource k8s:deploy
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse JKube migration for OpenShift users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the same migration process for the OpenShift Maven Plugin as you would for the Kubernetes Maven Plugin. Run the &lt;code&gt;migrate&lt;/code&gt; goal but with the OpenShift MavenPlugin specified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ mvn org.eclipse.jkube:openshift-maven-plugin:migrate
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the logs for this &lt;code&gt;migrate&lt;/code&gt; goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;fmp-demo-project : $ mvn org.eclipse.jkube:openshift-maven-plugin:migrate

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goal replaces all of your Fabric8 Maven Plugin references with references to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/docs/openshift-maven-plugin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenShift Maven Plugin&lt;/a&gt;. You can then deploy your application to Red Hat OpenShift just as you normally would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ mvn oc:build oc:resource oc:deploy
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

	<title>N4JS: N4JS goes LSP</title>

	<link>https://n4js.blogspot.com/2020/09/n4js-goes-lsp.html</link>

This was one of the last steps on our road to support LSP-based development tools. We chose to make this major change because of several reasons that affected both users and developers of N4JS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2efQTbpqKM/X1YXgPPtOzI/AAAAAAAAARA/6GuSg2_-kc8F_CWYnhfQ0dUw1XL5bRmUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1822/N4JS_VSCODE.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2efQTbpqKM/X1YXgPPtOzI/AAAAAAAAARA/6GuSg2_-kc8F_CWYnhfQ0dUw1XL5bRmUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/N4JS_VSCODE.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;An N4JS project in VSCode with the N4JS language extension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-302ce6de-7fff-db87-f1b6-82f1bec7268d&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;Our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=n4js.n4js-vscode-extension&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #1155cc; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;language extension for N4JS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt; is hosted at the Microsoft VSCode Marketplace and will be updated regularly by our Jenkins jobs. Versions will be kept in sync with the language version, compiler version and version of the N4JS libraries to avoid incompatible setups. At the moment, the LSP server supports all main features of the language server protocol (LSP) such as validation, content assist, outline view, jump to definition and implementation, open symbol, the rename refactoring and many more. In addition, it will also generate output files whenever a source change is detected. We therefore heavily improved the incremental LSP builder of the Xtext framework and plan to migrate back those changes to the Xtext repository. For the near future we plan to work on stability, performance and also to support some of the less frequently used LSP features.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;When looking back, development of N4JS has been based on the Xtext framework from the start and thus it was straightforward to build an Eclipse-based IDE as our main development tool. Later on, we also implemented a headless compiler used for manual and automated testing from the command line. The development of the compiler already indicated some problems stemming from the tight integration of the Eclipse and the Xtext frameworks together with our language specific implementations. To name an example, we had two separate builder implementations: one for the IDE and the other for the headless compiler. Since the Eclipse IDE is using a specific workspace and project model, we also had two implementations for this abstraction. Another important problem we faced with developing an Eclipse-based IDE was that at some points we had to implement UI tests using the SWTBot framework. For us, SWTBot tests turned out to be very hard to develop, to maintain, and to keep from becoming flaky. Shifting to LSP-based development tools, i.e. the headless compiler and an LSP server, allows us to overcome the aforementioned problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;Users of N4JS now have the option to either use our extension for VSCode or integrate our LSP server into their favorite IDE themselves, even into the Eclipse IDE. They also benefit from more lightweight tools regarding disk size and start-up performance, as well as a better integration into well-known tools from the JavaScript development ecosystem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Ed Merks: No Java? No Problem!</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3879044552984472733.post-6596989719963525978</guid>
	<link>https://ed-merks.blogspot.com/2020/08/no-java-no-problem.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For the 2020-09 Eclipse Simultaneous Release, the Eclipse IDE will require Java 11 or higher to run.  If the user doesn't have that installed, Eclipse simply won't start, instead popping up this dialog:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0sWgK4UlI2w/XzuCCZMXseI/AAAAAAAAC3Q/2p5CYOLDLt4Az5NpyV6aCpPTGAHoNzp0gCLcBGAsYHQ/s584/IncompatibleJVM.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;131&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0sWgK4UlI2w/XzuCCZMXseI/AAAAAAAAC3Q/2p5CYOLDLt4Az5NpyV6aCpPTGAHoNzp0gCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h131/IncompatibleJVM.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That of course begs the question, what should I do now? The Eclipse Installer itself is an Eclipse application so it too will fail to start for the same reason.  At least on Windows the Eclipse Installer is distributed as a native executable, so it will open a &lt;a href=&quot;https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/jre/?vm=1_11_0_0_64_0&amp;amp;pn=Eclipse%20Installer&amp;amp;pu=http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Installer&amp;amp;pi=http://download.eclipse.org/oomph/jre/128x128.png&quot;&gt;semi-helpful page&lt;/a&gt; in the browser to direct the user find a suitable JRE or JDK to install rather than popping up the above dialog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course we are concerned that many users will update 2020-06 to 2020-09 only to find that Eclipse fails to start afterwards because they are currently running with Java 8.  But Mickael Istria has planned ahead for this as part of the 2020-06 release, adding a validation check during the update process to determine if the current JVM is suitable for the update, thereby helping prevent this particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/justj/&quot;&gt;JustJ&lt;/a&gt; is available for building Eclipse products with an embedded JRE, we can do even better.  Several of the Eclipse Packaging Project's products will include a JustJ JRE in the packages for 2020-09, i.e., the C/C++, Rust, and JavaScript packages.  Also the Eclipse Installer for 2020-09 will provide product variants that include a JustJ JRE.  So they all will simply run out of the box regardless of which version of Java is installed and of course even when Java is not installed at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, the Eclipse Installer will provide JustJ JREs as choices in the dialogs.  A user who does not have Java installed will be offered JustJ JRE 14.02 as the default JRE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpZhpceqWL4/XzuCM0P-TGI/AAAAAAAAC3U/-1gvMtOltfws79deVlTd96b3Yfbjuir7QCLcBGAsYHQ/s937/EclipseInstallerJustJ.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;203&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpZhpceqWL4/XzuCM0P-TGI/AAAAAAAAC3U/-1gvMtOltfws79deVlTd96b3Yfbjuir7QCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h203/EclipseInstallerJustJ.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choices of JustJ JREs will always be available in the Eclipse Installer; it will be the default only if no suitable version of Java is currently installed on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Installers with an embedded JustJ JRE will be available starting with 2020-09 M3 for all supported platforms.  For a sneak preview, you can find them in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://download.eclipse.org/justj/?file=oomph/products/latest&quot;&gt;nightly builds folder&lt;/a&gt;.  The ones with &quot;-jre&quot; in the name contain an embedded JRE (and the ones with &quot;-restricted&quot; in the name will only install 2020-09 versions of the products).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a &lt;b&gt;lot of work &lt;/b&gt;getting this all in place, both building the JREs and updating Oomph's build to consume them.  Not only that, just this week I had to rework EMF's build so that it functions with the latest platform where some of the JDT bundles have incremented their BREEs to Java 11.  There's always something disruptive that creates a lot of work.  I should point out that no one funds this work, so I often question how this is all actually sustainable in the long term (not to mention questioning my personal sanity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did found a small GmbH here in Switzerland.  It's very pretty here!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0B499FykO6A/XzuG-sxC9xI/AAAAAAAAC3k/VUgeP9BoWc4CO-MRFireV7E9cRrNQ60hwCLcBGAsYHQ/s5184/IMG_3326.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0B499FykO6A/XzuG-sxC9xI/AAAAAAAAC3k/VUgeP9BoWc4CO-MRFireV7E9cRrNQ60hwCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h240/IMG_3326.JPG&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need help, consider that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macromodeling.com/&quot;&gt;help is available&lt;/a&gt;. If no one pays for anything, at some point you will only get what you pay for, i.e., nothing. But that's a topic for another blog...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wayne Beaton: Dogfooding the Eclipse Dash License Tool</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/?p=5692</guid>
	<link>https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2020/07/22/dogfooding-the-eclipse-dash-license-tool/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s background information about this post in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2020/05/07/revising-the-eclipse-ip-due-diligence-process-for-third-party-content/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/dash-licenses&quot;&gt;Eclipse Dash License Tool&lt;/a&gt; on itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ mvn dependency:list | grep -Poh &quot;\S+:(system|provided|compile)$&quot; | java -jar licenses.jar -
Querying Eclipse Foundation for license data for 7 items.
Found 6 items.
Querying ClearlyDefined for license data for 1 items.
Found 1 items.
Vetted license information was found for all content. No further investigation is required.
$ _&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in this example, I’ve removed the paths to try and reduce at least some of the clutter. I also tend to add a filter to sort the dependencies and remove duplicates (&lt;code&gt;| sort | uniq&lt;/code&gt;), but that’s not required here so I’ve left it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message that “[v]etted license information was found for all content”, means that the tool figures that all of my project’s dependencies have been fully vetted and that I’m good to go. I could, for example, create a release with this content and be fully aligned with the Eclipse Foundation’s Intellectual Property Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool is, however, only as good as the information that it’s provided with. Checking only the Maven build completely misses the third party content that was introduced by Jonah’s helpful contribution that helps us obtain dependency information from a &lt;code&gt;yarn.lock&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ cd yarn
$ node index.js | java -jar licenses.jar -
Querying Eclipse Foundation for license data for 1 items.
Found 0 items.
Querying ClearlyDefined for license data for 1 items.
Rejected: https://clearlydefined.io/definitions/npm/npmjs/@yarnpkg/lockfile/1.1.0
Found 0 items.
License information could not automatically verified for the following content:

npm/npmjs/@yarnpkg/lockfile/1.1.0 (null)

Please create contribution questionnaires for this content.

$ _&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… oops. Missed one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the updates to the IP Policy include a change that allows project teams to leverage third-party content (that they believe to be license compatible) in their project code during development. All content must be vetted by the IP due diligence process before it may be leveraged by any &lt;em&gt;release&lt;/em&gt;. So the project in its current state is completely onside, but the license of that identified bit of content needs to be resolved before it can be declared as proper release as defined by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation Development Process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually demonstrates why I opted to create the tool as CLI that takes a flat list of dependencies as input: we use all sorts of different technologies, and I wanted to focus the tool on providing license information for arbitrary lists of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m sure that Denis will be able to rewrite my bash one-liner in seven keystrokes, but here’s how I’ve combined the two so that I can get complete picture with a “single” command:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ { mvn dependency:list | grep -Poh &quot;\S+:(system|provided|compile)$&quot; ; cd yarn &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node index.js; } | java -jar licenses.jar -
Querying Eclipse Foundation for license data for 8 items.
Found 6 items.
Querying ClearlyDefined for license data for 2 items.
Rejected: https://clearlydefined.io/definitions/npm/npmjs/@yarnpkg/lockfile/1.1.0
Found 1 items.
License information could not automatically verified for the following content:

npm/npmjs/@yarnpkg/lockfile/1.1.0 (null)

Please create contribution questionnaires for this content.
$ _&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some work to do before I can release. I’ll need to engage with the Eclipse Foundation’s IP Team to have that one bit of content vetted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side effect, the tool generates a &lt;code&gt;DEPENDENCIES&lt;/code&gt; file. The dependency file lists all of the dependencies provided in the input in &lt;a href=&quot;https://clearlydefined.io&quot;&gt;ClearlyDefined&lt;/a&gt; coordinates along with license information, whether or not the content is &lt;em&gt;approved&lt;/em&gt; for use or is &lt;em&gt;restricted&lt;/em&gt; (meaning that further investigation is required), and the authority that determined the status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;maven/mavencentral/org.glassfish/jakarta.json/1.1.6, EPL-2.0 OR GPL-2.0 WITH Classpath-exception-2.0, approved, emo_ip_team
maven/mavencentral/commons-codec/commons-codec/1.11, Apache-2.0, approved, CQ15971
maven/mavencentral/org.apache.httpcomponents/httpcore/4.4.13, Apache-2.0, approved, CQ18704
maven/mavencentral/commons-cli/commons-cli/1.4, Apache-2.0, approved, CQ13132
maven/mavencentral/org.apache.httpcomponents/httpclient/4.5.12, Apache-2.0, approved, CQ18703
maven/mavencentral/commons-logging/commons-logging/1.2, Apache-2.0, approved, CQ10162
maven/mavencentral/org.apache.commons/commons-csv/1.8, Apache-2.0, approved, clearlydefined
npm/npmjs/@yarnpkg/lockfile/1.1.0, unknown, &lt;strong&gt;restricted&lt;/strong&gt;, none&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the content was vetted by the Eclipse Foundation’s IP Team (the entries marked “CQ*” have corresponding entries in IPZilla), one was found in ClearlyDefined, and one requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool produces good results. But, as I stated earlier, it’s only as good as the input that it’s provided with and it only does what it is designed to do (it doesn’t, for example, distinguish between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-third-party-prereq&quot;&gt;prerequisite dependencies&lt;/a&gt; and dependencies of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-third-party-workswith&quot;&gt;works with&lt;/a&gt;” dependencies; more on this later). The output of the tool is obviously a little rough and could benefit from the use of a proper configurable &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/dash-licenses/issues/9&quot;&gt;logging framework&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a handful of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/dash-licenses/issues&quot;&gt;other open issues&lt;/a&gt; for your consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex Blewitt: Why ServiceCaller is better (than ServiceTracker)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://alblue.bandlem.com/2020/07/why-servicecaller-is-better</guid>
	<link>https://alblue.bandlem.com/2020/07/why-servicecaller-is-better.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://alblue.bandlem.com/2020/07/why-servicetracker-is-bad.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; spurned a
reasonable amount of discussion, and I promised to also talk about the new
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt; which simplifies a number of these issues. I also thought it
was worth looking at what the criticisms were because they made valid points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alblue/why-servicetracker-is-bad/pull/1/files&quot;&gt;first observation&lt;/a&gt;
is that it’s possible to use both DS and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; to track
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceReference&lt;/code&gt;s instead. In this mode, the services aren’t triggered by
default; instead, they only get accessed upon resolving the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt;
using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getService()&lt;/code&gt; call. This isn’t the default out of the box, because
you have to write a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTrackerCustomizer&lt;/code&gt; adapter that intercepts the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addingService()&lt;/code&gt; call to wrap the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; for future use. In other
words, if you change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code-highlight-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;code-highlight-pre&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;serviceTracker = new ServiceTracker&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(bundleContext, Runnable.class, null);
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;serviceTracker.open();&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to the slightly more verbose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code-highlight-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;code-highlight-pre&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;serviceTracker = new ServiceTracker&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(bundleContext, Runnable.class,
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;  new ServiceTrackerCustomizer&amp;lt;Runnable, Wrapped&amp;lt;Runnable&amp;gt;&amp;gt;() {
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;    public Wrapped&amp;lt;Runnable&amp;gt; addingService(ServiceReference&amp;lt;Runnable&amp;gt; ref) {
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;      return new Wrapped&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(ref, bundleContext);
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;	}
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;  }
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;}
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;static class Wrapped&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;	}
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;  }
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, no practical code uses this approach because it’s too verbose, and
if you’re in an environment where DS services aren’t widely used, the benefits
of the deferred approach are outweighed by the quantity of additional
code that needs to be written in order to implement this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The code above is also slightly buggy; we’re getting the service, returning
it, then ungetting it afterwards. We should really just be using it during
that call instead of returning it in that case.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-servicecaller&quot;&gt;Introducing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/rt.equinox.bundles/blob/master/bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.common/src/org/eclipse/core/runtime/ServiceCaller.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt; is to optimise out the over-eager
dereferencing of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; approach, and apply a functional approach
to calling the service when required. It also has a mechanism to do single-shot
lookups and calling of services; helpful, for example, when logging an obscure
error condition or other rarely used code path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to elegantly call functional interfaces in a single line of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code-highlight-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;code-highlight-pre&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;Class callerClass = getClass();
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller.callOnce(callerClass, Runnable.class, Runnable:run);&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This call looks for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; service types, as visible from the caller class,
and then invoke the function &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getClass()&lt;/code&gt; as lambda. We can use a method
reference (as in the above case) or you can supply a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Consumer&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which will
be passed the reference that is resolved from the lookup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this call doesn’t acquire the service until the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;callOnce&lt;/code&gt; call is
made. So, if you have an expensive logging factory, you don’t have to
initialise it until the first time it’s needed – and even better, if the error
condition never occurs, you never need to look it up. This is in direct
contrast to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; approach (which actually needs more characters
to type) that accesses the services eagerly, and is an order of magnitude
better than having to write a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTrackerCustomiser&lt;/code&gt; for the purposes of
working around a broken API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, note that such one-shot calls are not the most efficient way of doing
this, especially if it is to be called frequently. So the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt; has
another mode of operation; you can create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt; instance, and hang
onto it for further use. Like its single-shot counterpart, this will defer the
resolution of the service until needed. Furthermore, once resolved, it will
cache that instance so you can repeatedly re-use it, in the same way that you
could do with the service returned from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code-highlight-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;code-highlight-pre&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;private ServiceCaller&amp;lt;Runnable&amp;gt; service;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;public void start(BundleContext context) {
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;  this.service = new ServiceCaller&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(getClass(), Runnable.class);
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;}
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;public void stop(BundleContext context) {
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;  this.service.unget();
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;}
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;public void doSomething() {
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;  service.call(Runnable::run);
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t involve significantly more effort than using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt;
that’s widely in use in Eclipse Activators at the moment, yet will defer the
lookup of the service until it’s actually needed. It’s obviously better than
writing many lines of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTrackerCustomiser&lt;/code&gt; and performs better as a
result, and is in most cases a type of drop-in replacement. However, unlike
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; (which returns you a service that you can then do something
with afterwards), this call provides a functional consumer interface that
allows you to pass in the action to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve looked at why &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; has problems with eager instantiation of
services, and the complexity of code required to do it the right way. A scan
of the Eclipse codebase suggests that outside of Equinox, there are very few
uses of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTrackerCustomiser&lt;/code&gt; and there are several hundred calls to
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker(xxx,yyy,null)&lt;/code&gt; – so there’s a lot of improvements that can
be made fairly easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern can also be used to push down the acquisition of the service
from a generic Plugin/Activator level call to where it needs to be used.
Instead of standing this up in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BundleActivator&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt;
can be used anywhere in the bundle’s code. This is where the real benefit
comes in; by packaging it up into a simple, functional consumer, we can
use it to incrementally rid ourselves of the various &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BundleActivator&lt;/code&gt;s that
take up the majority of Eclipse’s start-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final note on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt; – it’s possible that when you run the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;callOnce&lt;/code&gt; method (or the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; method if you’re holding on to it) that a
service instance won’t be available. If that’s the case, you get notified by a
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; return call from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; method. If a service is found and is
processed, you’ll get a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; returned. For some operations, a no-op is a fine
behaviour if the service isn’t present – for example, if there’s no
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LogService&lt;/code&gt; then you’re probably going to drop the log event anyway – but it
allows you to take the corrective action you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does mean that if you want to capture return state from the method call then
you’ll need to have an alternative approach. The easiest way is to have an
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;final Object result[] = new Object[1];&lt;/code&gt; before the call, and then the lambda
can assign the return value to the array. That’s because local state captured
by lambdas needs to be a final reference, but a final reference to a mutable
single element array allows us to poke a single value back. You could of course
use a different class for the array, depending on your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have seen that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt; is better than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt;, but can
we do even better than that? We certainly can, and that’s the purpose of the
next post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex Blewitt: Why ServiceTracker is Bad (for DS)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://alblue.bandlem.com/2020/07/why-servicetracker-is-bad</guid>
	<link>https://alblue.bandlem.com/2020/07/why-servicetracker-is-bad.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a presentation I gave at EclipseCon Europe in 2016, I noted that there were prolems when using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/alblue/optimising-eclipse-plug-ins?slide=37&quot;&gt;slide 37 of my presentation&lt;/a&gt; noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker.open()&lt;/code&gt; is a blocking call&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker.open()&lt;/code&gt; results in DS activating services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=564876#c3&quot;&gt;not everyone agrees&lt;/a&gt; because it seems insane that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; should do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; is insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of Declarative Services (aka SCR, although no-one calls it that)
is that you can register services declaratively, but more importantly, the DS
runtime will present the existence of the service but defer instantiation of
the component until it’s first requested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about this is that you can have a service which does many class
loads or timely actions and defer its use until the service is actually needed.
If your service isn’t required, then you don’t pay the cost for instantiating
that service. I don’t think there’s any debate that this is a Good Thing and
everyone, so far, is happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, specifically when using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt;, is that you have to do a two-step process to use it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; for your particular service class&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt; on it to start looking for services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time passes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You acquire the service form the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; to do something with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a generally held mistaken belief that the DS component is not
instantiated until you hit step 4 in the above. After all, if you’re calling
the service from another component – or even looking up the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceReference&lt;/code&gt;
yourself – that’s what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; happens is that the DS component is instantiated in step 2
above. That’s because the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt; call – which is nicely thread-safe by the
way, in the way that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getService()&lt;/code&gt; isn’t – starts looking for services, and
then caches the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;InitialTracked&lt;/code&gt; service, which causes DS to instantiate the
component for you. Since most DS components often have a default, no-arg
constructor, this generally misses most people’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your component’s constructor – or more importantly, the fields therein,
cause many classes to be loaded or perform substantial work or calculation, the
fact that you’re hitting a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker.open()&lt;/code&gt; synchronized call can take
some non-trivial amount of time. And since this is typically in an
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Activator.start()&lt;/code&gt; method, it means that your nicely delay-until-its-needed
component is now on the critical path of this bundle’s start-up, despite not
actually needing the service right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the main problems in Eclipse’s start-up; many, many thousands of
classes are loaded too eagerly. I’ve been working over the years to try and
reduce the problem but it’s an uphill struggle and bad patterns (particularly
the use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Activator&lt;/code&gt;) are endemic in a non-trivial subset of the Eclipse
ecosystem. Of course, there are many fine and historical reasons why this is
the case, not the least of which is that we didn’t start shipping DS in the
Eclipse runtime until fairly recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;repo-repro&quot;&gt;Repo repro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you point this out, not everyone is aware of this subtle
behaviour. And while opinions may differ, code does not. I have put together a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alblue/why-servicetracker-is-bad&quot;&gt;sample project&lt;/a&gt; which has
two bundles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client, which has an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Activator&lt;/code&gt; (yeah I know, I’m using it to make a point) that uses a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; to look for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; instances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Runner, which has a DS component that provides a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When launched together, as soon as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker.open()&lt;/code&gt; method is called, you can see the console printing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;Component has been instantiated&quot;&lt;/code&gt; message. This is despite the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; bundle never actually using the service that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; causes to be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run it with the system property &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-DdisableOpen=true&lt;/code&gt;, the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker.open()&lt;/code&gt; statement is not called, and the component is not
instantiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a non-trivial reason as to why Eclipse startup can be slow. There are
many, many uses of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; to reach out to other parts of the system,
and regardless of whether these are lazy DS components or have been actively
instantiated, the use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker.open()&lt;/code&gt; causes them to all be eagerly
activated, even before they’re needed. We can migrate Eclipse’s services to DS
(and in fact, I’m working on doing just that) but until we eliminate the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; from various Activators, we won’t see the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alblue/why-servicetracker-is-bad&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt; essentially boils down to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code-highlight-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;code-highlight-pre&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;BundleContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundleContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;serviceTracker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundleContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getBoolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;disableOpen&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;serviceTracker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This will cause a DS component to be instantiated even though we don't use it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-row numbered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;code-highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no way to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt; to listen to lazily activated services, and as an OSGi standard, the behaviour is baked in to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s a lighter-weight tracker you can use called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/rt.equinox.bundles/blob/master/bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.common/src/org/eclipse/core/runtime/ServiceCaller.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceCaller&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
– but that’s a topic for another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker.open()&lt;/code&gt; will cause lazily instantiated DS components to
be activated eagerly, before the service is used. Instead of using
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServiceTracker&lt;/code&gt;, try moving your service out to a DS component, and then DS
will do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quarkus is advertised as a “Kubernetes Native Java stack, â€¦”, so we took it to a test, and checked what benefits we can get, by replacing an existing service from the IoT components of &lt;a href=&quot;https://enmasse.io/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EnMasse&lt;/a&gt;, the cloud-native, self-service messaging system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The context&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For quite a while, I wanted to try out Quarkus. I wanted to see what benefits it brings us in the context of EnMasse. The IoT functionality of EnMasse is provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/hono/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Hono&lt;img alt=&quot;â„¢&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a micro-service based IoT connectivity platform. Hono is written in Java, makes heavy use of Vert.x, and the application startup and configuration is being orchestrated by Spring Boot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;EnMasse provides the scalable messaging back-end, based on AMQP 1.0. It also takes care of the Eclipse Hono deployment, alongside EnMasse. Wiring up the different services, based on an infrastructure &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;custom resource&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, you create a snippet of YAML, and EnMasse takes care and deploys a messaging system for you, with first-class support for IoT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Architecture diagram, explaining the tenant service.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4446&quot; height=&quot;116&quot; src=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/architecture.svg&quot; width=&quot;239&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Architectural overview – showing the Tenant Service&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This system requires a service called the “tenant service”. That service is responsible for looking up an IoT tenant, whenever the system needs to validate that a tenant exists or when its configuration is required. Like all the other services in Hono, this service is implemented using the default stack, based on Java, Vert.x, and Spring Boot. Most of the implementation is based on Vert.x alone, using its reactive and asynchronous programming model. Spring Boot is only used for wiring up the application, using dependency injection and configuration management. So this isn’t a typical Spring Boot application, it is neither using Spring Web or any of the Spring Messaging components. And the reason for choosing Vert.x over Spring in the past was performance. Vert.x provides an excellent performance, which we tested a while back in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/2018/07/25/scaling-iot-eclipse-hono/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IoT scale test with Hono&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The goal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal was simple: make it use fewer resources, having the same functionality. We didn’t want to re-implement the whole service from scratch. And while the tenant service is specific to EnMasse, it still uses quite a lot of the base functionality coming from Hono. And we wanted to re-use all of that, as we did with Spring Boot. So this wasn’t one of those nice “greenfield” projects, where you can start from scratch, with a nice and clean “Hello World”. This is code is embedded in two bigger projects, passes system tests, and has a history of its own.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, change as little as possible and get out as much as we can. What else could it be?! And just to understand from where we started, here is a screenshot of the metrics of the tenant service instance on my test cluster:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of original resource consumption.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4456&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; src=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/before-1024x358.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Metrics for the original Spring Boot application&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around 200MiB of RAM, a little bit of CPU, and not much to do. As mentioned before, the tenant service only gets queries to verify the existence of a tenant, and the system will cache this information for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step #1 â€“ Migrate to Quarkus&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To use Quarkus, we started to tweak our existing project, to adopt the different APIs that Quarkus uses for dependency injection and configuration. And to be fair, that mostly meant saying good-bye to Spring Boot specific APIs, going for something more open. &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dependency Injection in Quarkus&lt;/a&gt; comes in the form of CDI. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/guides/config#injecting-configuration-value&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quarkus’ configuration is based on Eclipse MicroProfile Config&lt;/a&gt;. In a way, we didn’t migrate to Quarkus, but away from Spring Boot specific APIs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;First steps&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting with adding the Quarkus Maven plugin and some basic dependencies to our Maven build, and off we go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while replacing dependency inject was a rather smooth process, the configuration part was a bit more tricky. Both Hono and Microprofile Config have a rather opinionated view on the configuration. Which made it problematic to enhance the Hono configuration in the way that Microprofile was happy. So for the first iteration, we ended up wrapping the Hono configuration classes to make them play nice with Microprofile. However, this is something that we intend to improve in Hono in the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Packaging the JAR into a container was no different than with the existing version. We only had to adapt the EnMasse operator to provide application arguments in the form Quarkus expected them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;First results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From a user perspective, nothing has changed. The tenant service still works the way it is expected to work and provides all the APIs as it did before. Just running with the Quarkus runtime, and the same &lt;abbr title=&quot;Java Virtual Machine&quot;&gt;JVM&lt;/abbr&gt; as before:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of resource consumption with Quarkus in JVM mode.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4457&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; src=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/quarkus_jvm-1024x355.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Metrics after the conversion to Quarkus, in JVM mode&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can directly see a drop of 50MiB from 200MiB to 150MiB of RAM, that isn’t bad. CPU isn’t really different, though. There also is a slight improvement of the startup time, from ~2.5 seconds down to ~2 seconds. But that isn’t a real game-changer, I would say. Considering that ~2.5 seconds startup time, for a Spring Boot application, is actually not too bad, other services take much longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Step #2 â€“ The native image&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to do Java “native compilation”. I guess the expectation is that native compilation makes everything go much faster. There are different tests by different people, comparing native compilation and JVM mode, and the outcomes vary a lot. I don’t think that “native images” are a silver bullet to performance issues, but still, we have been curious to give it a try and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Native image with Quarkus&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enabling native image mode in Quarkus is trivial. You need to add a Maven profile, set a few properties and you have native image generation enabled. With setting a single property in the Maven POM file, you can also instruct the Quarkus plugin to perform the native compilation step in a container. With that, you don’t need to worry about the GraalVM installation on your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Native image generation can be tricky, we knew that. However, we didn’t expect this to be as complex as being “Step #2”. In a nutshell, creating a native image compiles your code to CPU instruction, rather than JVM bytecode. In order to do that, it traces the call graph, and it fails to do so when it comes to reflection in Java. GraalVM supports reflection, but you need to provide the information about types, classes, and methods that want to participate in the reflection system, from the outside. Luckily Quarkus provides tooling to generate this information during the build. Quarkus knows about constructs like de-serialization in Jackson and can generate the required information for GraalVM to compile this correctly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the magic only works in areas that Quarkus is aware of. So we did run into some weird issues, strange behavior that was hard to track down. Things that worked in JVM mode all of a sudden were broken in native image mode. Not all the hints are in the documentation. And we also didn’t read (or understand) all of the hints that are there. It takes a bit of time to learn, and with a lot of help from some colleagues (many thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/geoand86&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Georgios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xstefank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dejanb&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dejan&lt;/a&gt; for all the support), we got it running.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;What is the benefit?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all the struggle, what did it give us?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshot of resource consumption with Quarkus in native image mode.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4458&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; src=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/quarkus_native-1024x355.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Metrics when running as native image Quarkus application&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, we are down another 50MiB of RAM. Starting from ~200MiB, down to ~100MiB. That is only half the RAM! Also, this time, we see a reduction in CPU load. While in JVM mode (both Quarkus and Spring Boot), the CPU load was around 2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;millicores&lt;/a&gt;, now the CPU is always below that, even during application startup. Startup time is down from ~2.5 seconds with Spring Boot, to ~2 seconds with Quarkus in JVM mode, to ~0.4 seconds for Quarkus in native image mode. Definitely an improvement, but still, neither of those times is really bad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Pros and cons of Quarkus&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Switching to Quarkus was no problem at all. We found a few areas in the Hono configuration classes to improve. But in the end, we can keep the original Spring Boot setup and have Quarkus at the same time. Possibly other Microprofile compatible frameworks as well, though we didn’t test that. Everything worked as before, just using less memory. And except for the configuration classes, we could pretty much keep the whole application as it was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Native image generation was more complex than expected. However, we also saw some real benefits. And while we didn’t do any performance tests on that, here is a thought: if the service has the same performance as before, the fact that it requires only half the of memory, and half the CPU cycles, this allows us to run twice the amount of instances now. Doubling throughput, as we can scale horizontally. I am really looking forward to another scale test since we did do all other kinds of optimizations as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should also consider that the process of building a native image takes quite an amount of time. For this, rather simple service, it takes around 3 minutes on an above-than-average machine, just to build the native image. I did notice some decent improvement when trying out GraalVM 20.0 over 19.3, so I would expect some more improvements on the toolchain over time. Things like hot code replacement while debugging, are things that are not possible with the native image profile though. It is a different workflow, and that may take a bit to adapt. However, you don’t need to commit to either way. You can still have both at the same time. You can work with JVM mode and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started#development-mode&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quarkus development mode&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;enable the native image profile&lt;/a&gt;, whenever you are ready.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the size of the container images, I noticed that the native image isn’t smaller (~85 MiB), compared to the uber-JAR file (~45 MiB). Then again, our “java base” image alone is around ~435 MiB. And it only adds the JVM on top of the Fedora minimal image. As you don’t need the JVM when you have the native image, you can go directly with the Fedora minimal image, which is around ~165 MiB, and end up with a much smaller overall image.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Switching our existing Java project to Quarkus wasn’t a big deal. It required some changes, yes. But those changes also mean, using some more open APIs, governed by the Eclipse Foundation’s development process, compared to using Spring Boot specific APIs. And while you can still use Spring Boot, changing the configuration to Eclipse MicroProfile opens up other possibilities as well. Not only Quarkus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just by taking a quick look at the numbers, comparing the figures from Spring Boot to Quarkus with native image compilation: RAM consumption was down to 50% of the original, CPU usage also was down to at least 50% of original usage, and the container image shrank to ~50% of the original size. And as mentioned in the beginning, we have been using Vert.x for all the core processing. Users that make use of the other Spring components should see more considerable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I hope we can bring the changes we made to the next versions of EnMasse and Eclipse Hono. There is a real benefit here, and it provides you with some awesome additional choices. And in case you don’t like to choose, the EnMasse operator has some reasonable defaults for you &lt;img alt=&quot;ðŸ˜‰&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wayne Beaton: Updates to the Eclipse IP Due Diligence Process</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/?p=5705</guid>
	<link>https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2020/06/25/updates-to-the-eclipse-ip-due-diligence-process/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, The Eclipse Foundation’s Board of Directors approved an update to the IP Policy that introduces several significant changes in our IP due diligence process. I’ve just pushed out an update to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip&quot;&gt;Intellectual Property&lt;/a&gt; section in the Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll apologize in advance that the updates are still a little rough and require some refinements. Like the rest of the handbook, we continually revise and rework the content based on your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick summary of the most significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;License certification only for third-party content.&lt;/strong&gt; This change removes the requirement to perform deep copyright, provenance and scanning of anomalies for third-party content unless it is being modified and/or if there are &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; considerations regarding the content. Instead, the focus for third-party content is on &lt;em&gt;license compatibility&lt;/em&gt; only, which had previously been referred to as &lt;em&gt;Type A&lt;/em&gt; due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage other sources of license information for third-party content.&lt;/strong&gt; With this change to license certification only for third-party content, we are able to leverage existing sources of information license information. That is, the requirement that the Eclipse IP Team personally review every bit of third-party content has been removed and we can now leverage other &lt;em&gt;trusted&lt;/em&gt; sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ClearlyDefined is a &lt;em&gt;trusted&lt;/em&gt; source of license information.&lt;/strong&gt; We currently have two trusted sources of license information: The Eclipse Foundation’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-ipzilla&quot;&gt;IPZilla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-clearlydefined&quot;&gt;ClearlyDefined&lt;/a&gt;. The IPZilla database has been painstakingly built over most of the lifespan of the Eclipse Foundation; it contains a vast wealth of deeply vetted information about many versions of many third-party libraries. ClearlyDefined is an OSI project that combines automated harvesting of software repositories and curation by trusted members of the community to produce a massive database of license (and other) information about content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piggyback CQs are no longer required.&lt;/strong&gt; CQs had previously been used for tracking both the vetting process and the use of third-party content. With the changes, we are no longer required track the use of third-party content using CQs, so piggyback CQs are no longer necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallel IP is used in all cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Previously, our so-called &lt;em&gt;Parallel IP&lt;/em&gt; process, the means by which project teams could leverage content during development while the IP Team completed their due diligence review was available only to projects in the &lt;em&gt;incubation phase&lt;/em&gt; and only for content with specific conditions. This is no longer the case: full vetting is now always applied in parallel in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CQs are not required for third-party content in all cases.&lt;/strong&gt; In the case of third-party content due diligence, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-cq&quot;&gt;CQs&lt;/a&gt; are now only used to track the vetting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CQs are no longer required &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; third-party content is introduced.&lt;/strong&gt; Previously, the IP Policy required that all third-party content must be vetted by the Eclipse IP Team before it can be used by an Eclipse Project. The IP Policy updates turn this around. Eclipse project teams may now introduce new third-party content during a development cycle without first checking with the IP Team. That is, a project team may commit build scripts, code references, etc. to third-party content to their source code repository without first creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-cq&quot;&gt;CQ&lt;/a&gt; to request IP Team review and approval of the third-party content. At least during the development period between releases, the onus is on the project team to—​with reasonable confidence—​ensure any third-party content that they introduce is license compatible with the project’s license. Before any content may be included in any formal release the project team must engage in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-prereq-diligence&quot;&gt;due diligence process&lt;/a&gt; to validate that the third-party content licenses are compatible with the project license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History may be retained when an existing project moves to the Eclipse Foundation.&lt;/strong&gt; We had previously required that the commit history for a project moving to the Eclipse Foundation be squashed and that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-initial-contribution&quot;&gt;initial contribution&lt;/a&gt; be the very first commit in the repository. This is no longer the case; existing projects are now encouraged (but not required) to retain their commit history. The initial contribution must still be provided to the IP Team via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-cq&quot;&gt;CQ&lt;/a&gt; as a snapshot of the &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; state of the existing repository (if any).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The due diligence process for project content is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you notice anything that looks particularly wrong or troubling, please either open a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Dash&amp;amp;component=Handbook&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt;, or send a note to EMO.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Ed Merks: Eclipse JustJ</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3879044552984472733.post-4024802254839825841</guid>
	<link>https://ed-merks.blogspot.com/2020/06/eclipse-justj.html</link>
	<description>&lt;div&gt;I've recently completed the initial support for provisioning the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/justj/&quot;&gt;Eclipse JustJ&lt;/a&gt; project, complete with a logo for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--SJ-lAj4jZU/XvRXKtFcMVI/AAAAAAAACzE/rK6Bv1AXbdgdCC8LvFBLcdfjWNjpqmQMgCK4BGAsYHg/s200/justj_title.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--SJ-lAj4jZU/XvRXKtFcMVI/AAAAAAAACzE/rK6Bv1AXbdgdCC8LvFBLcdfjWNjpqmQMgCK4BGAsYHg/justj_title.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've learned several new technologies and honed existing technology skills to make this happen. For example, I've previously used Inkscape to create nicer images for Oomph; a *.png with alpha is much better than a *.gif with a transparent pixel, particularly with the vogue, dark-theme fashion trend, which for old people like me feels more like the old days of CRT monitors than something modern, but hey, to each their own. In any case, a *.svg is cool, definitely looks great at every resolution, and can easily be rendered to a *.png.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By the way, did you know that artwork derivative of  Eclipse artwork requires special approval? Previously the Eclipse Board of Directors had to review and approve such logos, but now our beloved, supreme leader, Mike Milinkovich, is empowered to do that personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Getting to the point where we can redistribute JREs at Eclipse has been a long and winding road.  This of course required Board approval and your elected Committer Representatives helped push that to fruition last year.  Speaking of which, now there is an exciting late-breaking development: the move of &lt;a href=&quot;https://adoptopenjdk.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AdoptOpenJDK&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/06/adoptopenjdk-eclipse-adoptium/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&amp;amp;utm_source=infoq&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_term=Eclipse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Adoptium&lt;/a&gt;.  This will be an important source JREs for JustJ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the primary goals of JustJ is to provide JREs via p2 update sites such that a product build can easily incorporate a JRE into the product. With that in place, the product runs out-of-the-box regardless of the JRE installed on the end-user's computer, which is particularly useful for products that are not Java-centric where the end-user doesn't care about the fact that Eclipse is implemented using Java.  This will also enable the Eclipse Installer to run out-of-the-box and will enable the installer to create an installation that, at the user's discretion, uses a JRE provided by Eclipse. In all cases, this includes the ability to update the installation's embedded JRE as new ones are released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first stage is to build a JRE from a JDK using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/justj/?page=index#jlink&quot;&gt;jlink&lt;/a&gt;.  This must run natively on the JDK's actual supported operating system and hardware architecture.  Of course we want to automate this step, and all the steps involved in producing a p2 repository populated with JREs.  This is where I had to learn about Jenkins pipeline scripts.  I'm particularly grateful to MikaÃ«l Barbero for helping me get started with a simple example.  Now I am a pipeline junkie, and of course I had to learn Groovy as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the initial stage, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/justj/?page=index#jre&quot;&gt;generate the JREs&lt;/a&gt; themselves, and that involves using shell scripts effectively.  I'm not a big fan of shell scripts, but they're a necessary evil.  I authored a single script that produces JREs on all the supported operating systems; one that I can run locally on Windows and on my two virtual boxes as well. The pipeline itself needs to run certain stages on specific agents such that their steps are performed on the appropriate operating system and hardware.  I'm grate to &lt;span class=&quot;gD&quot; name=&quot;Robert.Hilbrich@dlr.de&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot;&gt;Robert Hilbrich of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dlr.de&quot;&gt;DLR&lt;/a&gt; for supporting JustJ's builds with their organization's resource packs!  He's also been kind enough to be one of our first test guinea pigs building a product with a JustJ JRE.  The initial stage produces a &lt;a href=&quot;https://download.eclipse.org/justj/www/?page=download#jre-downloads&quot;&gt;set of JREs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gD&quot; name=&quot;Robert.Hilbrich@dlr.de&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r2RYf3l1ZUk/XvRaGEkiLTI/AAAAAAAACzg/9w6Na3rjlEU7rTY_v51gFtZMRzxpibM6QCK4BGAsYHg/s5184/IMG_2959.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r2RYf3l1ZUk/XvRaGEkiLTI/AAAAAAAACzg/9w6Na3rjlEU7rTY_v51gFtZMRzxpibM6QCK4BGAsYHg/s320/IMG_2959.JPG&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gD&quot; name=&quot;Robert.Hilbrich@dlr.de&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the next stage, JREs need to be wrapped into plugins and features to produce a p2 repository via a Maven/Tycho build.  This is a huge amount of boiler plate scaffolding that is error-prone to author and challenging to maintain, especially when providing multiple JRE flavors.  So of course we want to automate the generation of this scaffolding as well.  Naturally if we're going to generate something, we need a model to capture the boiled-down essence of what needs to be generated.  So I whipped together an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/&quot;&gt;EMF&lt;/a&gt; model and used JET templates to sketch out the scaffolding. With the super cool &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.eclipse.org/2020-03/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.emf.doc%2Ftutorials%2Fjet%2Fjet.html&amp;amp;cp%3D30_1_3&quot;&gt;JET Editor&lt;/a&gt;, these are really easy to author and maintain.  This stage is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/justj/?page=index#jre-p2&quot;&gt;described in the documentation&lt;/a&gt; and produces a &lt;a href=&quot;https://download.eclipse.org/justj/www/?page=download#p2-update-sites&quot;&gt;p2 update site&lt;/a&gt;.  The sites are automatically maintained and the index pages are automatically generated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To author nice documentation I had to learn PHP much better.  It's really quite cool and very powerful, particularly for producing pages with dynamic content.  For example, I used it to implement more flexible browsing support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://download.eclipse.org/justj/?file=&quot;&gt;download.eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt; so that one can really see all the files present, even when there is an index.html or index.php in the folder.  In any case, there is now lots of documentation for JustJ to describe everything in detail, and it was authored with the help of PHP scaffolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last but not least, there is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Authoring&quot;&gt;Oomph&lt;/a&gt; setup to automate the provisioning of a full development environment along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/justj/?page=developer#setup&quot;&gt;a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to describe in detail everything in that workspace.  There's no excuse not to contribute.  While authoring this tutorial, I found that creating nice, appropriately-clipped screen captures is super annoying and very time consuming, so I dropped a little goodie into Oomph to make that easier.   You might want to try it. Just add &quot;-Dorg.eclipse.oomph.ui.screenshot=&amp;lt;some-folder-location&amp;gt;&quot; to your eclipse.ini to enable it.  Then, if you hit Ctrl twice quickly, screen captures will be produced immediately based on where your application currently has focus.  If you hit Shift twice quickly, screen captures will be produced after a short delay.  This allows you to bring up a menu from the menu bar, from a toolbar button, or a context menu, and capture that menu.  In all cases, the captures include the &quot;simulated&quot; mouse cursor and starts with the &quot;focus&quot;, expanding outward to the full enclosing window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The bottom line, JustJ generates &lt;b&gt;everything&lt;/b&gt; given just a set of URLs to JDKs as input, and it maintains &lt;b&gt;everything&lt;/b&gt; automatically.  It even provides an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/justj/?page=documentation#products&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of how to build a product with an embedded JRE to get you started quickly.  And thanks to some test guinea pigs, we know it really works as advertised.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BPgLVPZJvXg/XvRatdCFZ6I/AAAAAAAACz0/lYjJuA3eyikploEn7oxbwSA05ZmksryHQCK4BGAsYHg/s5184/IMG_3029.JPG&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BPgLVPZJvXg/XvRatdCFZ6I/AAAAAAAACz0/lYjJuA3eyikploEn7oxbwSA05ZmksryHQCK4BGAsYHg/s320/IMG_3029.JPG&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the personal front, during this time period, I finished my move to Switzerland.  Getting up early here is a feast for the eyes! The movers were scurrying around my apartment the same days as the 2020-06 release, which was also the same day as one of the Eclipse Board meetings.  That was a little too much to juggle at once! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At this point, I can make anything work and I can make anything that already works work even better. Need help with something?  I'm easy to find...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Karsten Thoms: Eclipse Oomph: Suppress Welcome Page</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://kthoms.wordpress.com/?p=1052</guid>
	<link>https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2020/03/19/eclipse-oomph-suppress-welcome-page/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I am frequently spawning Eclipse workspaces with Oomph setups and the first action I do when a new workspace is provisioned is to close Eclipse’s welcome page. So I wanted to suppress that for a current project setup. So I started searching where Eclipse stores the preference that disables the intro page. The location of that preference is within the workspace directory at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.ui.prefs&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the preference file is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;eclipse.preferences.version=1
showIntro=false&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to make Oomph create the preference file before the workspace is started the first time use a &lt;em&gt;Resource Creation&lt;/em&gt; task and set the &lt;em&gt;Target URL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;${workspace.location|uri}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.ui.prefs&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then put the above mentioned preference content as &lt;em&gt;Content&lt;/em&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1058&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/oomph_disable_welcome_page.png?w=584&amp;amp;h=344&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Niko Stotz: MPS’ Quest of the Holy GraalVM of Interpreters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/?p=458</guid>
	<link>https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/mps-quest-of-the-holy-graalvm-of-interpreters/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A vision how to combine MPS and GraalVM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way too long ago, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/high-performance-interpreters-for-jetbrains-mps/&quot;&gt;prototyped&lt;/a&gt; a way to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/&quot;&gt;GraalVM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/truffle&quot;&gt;Truffle&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/&quot;&gt;JetBrains MPS&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to pick up this work soon. In this article, I describe the &lt;em&gt;grand picture&lt;/em&gt; of what might be possible with this combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_part_i_get_it_working&quot;&gt;Part I: Get it Working&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_0_teach_annotation_processors_to_mps&quot;&gt;Step 0: Teach Annotation Processors to MPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truffle uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.compiler/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html&quot;&gt;Java Annotation Processors&lt;/a&gt; heavily. Unfortunately, MPS doesn’t support them during its internal Java compilation. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/MPS-27653&quot;&gt;feature request&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t show any activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we have to do it ourselves. A little less time ago, I started with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/enikao/mps-annotation-processor-facet/tree/intermediate-state&quot;&gt;alternative Java Facet&lt;/a&gt; to include Annotation Processors. I just pushed my work-in-progress state from 2018. As far as I remember, there were no fundamental problems with the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_optional_step_1_teach_truffle_structured_sources&quot;&gt;Optional Step 1: Teach Truffle Structured Sources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Truffle, all executed programs stem from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/source/Source.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Source&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, this &lt;tt&gt;Source&lt;/tt&gt; can only provide &lt;tt&gt;Byte&lt;/tt&gt;s or &lt;tt&gt;Character&lt;/tt&gt;s. In our case, we want to provide the input model. The prototype just put the &lt;em&gt;Node id&lt;/em&gt; of the input model as a String into the Source; later steps resolved the id against MPS API. This approach works and is acceptable; directly passing the input node as object would be much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_2_implement_truffle_annotations_as_mps_language&quot;&gt;Step 2: Implement Truffle Annotations as MPS Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to provide all additional hints as Annotations to Truffle. They are complex enough, so we want to leverage MPS’ language features to directly represent all Truffle concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be a simple one-to-one representation of Java Annotations as MPS Concepts, but I’d guess we can add some more semantics and checks. Such feedback within MPS should simplify the next steps: Annotation Processors (and thus, Truffle) have only limited options to report issues back to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use this MPS language to implement the interpreter for our DSL. This results in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/TruffleLanguage.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;TruffleLanguage&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for our DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_3_start_truffle_within_mps&quot;&gt;Step 3: Start Truffle within MPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time when I wrote the proof-of-concept, a &lt;tt&gt;TruffleLanguage&lt;/tt&gt; had to be loaded at JVM startup. To my understanding, Truffle overcame this limitation. I haven’t looked into the current possibilities in detail yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine two ways to provide our DSL interpreter to the Truffle runtime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;loweralpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always register &lt;tt&gt;MpsTruffleLanguage1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;MpsTruffleLanguage2&lt;/tt&gt;, etc. as placeholders. This would also work at JVM startup. If required, we can register additional placeholders with one JVM restart.&lt;br /&gt;
All &lt;em&gt;non-colliding&lt;/em&gt; DSL interpreters would be &lt;tt&gt;MpsTruffleLanguage1&lt;/tt&gt; from Truffle’s point of view. This works, as we know the MPS language for each input model, and can make sure Truffle uses the right evaluation for the node at hand. We might suffer a performance loss, as Truffle had to manage more evaluations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are non-colliding interpreters? Assume we have a state machine DSL, an expression DSL, and a test DSL. The expression DSL is used within the state machines; we provide an interpreter for both of them.&lt;br /&gt;
We provide two interpreters for the test DSL: One executes the test and checks the assertions, the other one only marks model nodes that are covered by the test.&lt;br /&gt;
The state machine interpreter, the expression interpreter, and the first test interpreter are non-colliding, as they never want to execute on the same model node. All of them go to &lt;tt&gt;MpsTruffleLanguage1&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The second test interpreter &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; collide, as it wants to do something with a node also covered by the other interpreters. We put it to &lt;tt&gt;MpsTruffleLanguage2&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We register every DSL interpreter as a separate &lt;tt&gt;TruffleLanguage&lt;/tt&gt;. Nice and clean one-to-one relation. In this scenario, we probably had to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/interop/InteropLibrary.html&quot;&gt;Truffle Language Interop&lt;/a&gt; right. I have not yet investigated this topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;translate-input-model&quot;&gt;Step 4: Translate Input Model to Truffle Nodes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of Truffle’s magic stems from its AST representation. Thus, we need to translate our input model (a.k.a. DSL instance, a.k.a. program to execute) from MPS nodes into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/Node.html&quot;&gt;Truffle &lt;tt&gt;Node&lt;/tt&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the Truffle AST would dynamically adopt any changes of the input model — like hot code replacement in a debugger, except we don’t want to stop the running program. From Truffle’s point of view this shouldn’t be a problem: It rewrites the AST all the time anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ModelingValueGroup/DclareForMPS&quot;&gt;DclareForMPS&lt;/a&gt; seems a fitting technology. We define mapping rules from MPS node to Truffle &lt;tt&gt;Node&lt;/tt&gt;. Dclare makes sure they are in sync, and input changes are propagated optimally. These rules could either be generic, or be generated from the interpreter definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to take care that Dclare doesn’t try to adapt the MPS nodes to Truffle’s optimizing AST changes (no back-propagation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We require special handling for edge cases of MPS → Truffle change propagation, e.g. the user deletes the currently executed part of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For memory optimization, we might translate only the entry nodes of our input model immediately. Instead of the actual child Truffle &lt;tt&gt;Node&lt;/tt&gt;s, we’d add special nodes that translate the next part of the AST.&lt;br /&gt;
Unloading the not required parts might be an issue. Also, on-demand processing seems to conflict with Dclare’s rule-based approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_part_ii_adapt_to_mps&quot;&gt;Part II: Adapt to MPS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_5_re_create_interpreter_language&quot;&gt;Step 5: Re-create Interpreter Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://mbeddr.com/interpreter/Interpreter.html&quot;&gt;MPS interpreter framework&lt;/a&gt; removes even more boilerplate from writing interpreters than Truffle. The same language concepts should be built again, as abstraction on top of the Truffle Annotation DSL. This would be a new language aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;migrate-framework&quot;&gt;Step 6: Migrate MPS Interpreter Framework&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had the Truffle-based interpreter language, we want to use it! Also, we don’t want to rewrite all our nice interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s feasible to automatically migrate at least large parts of the existing MPS interpreter framework to the new language. I would expect some manual adjustment, though. That’s the price we had to pay for two orders of magnitude performance improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;plumbing&quot;&gt;Step 7: Provide Plumbing for BaseLanguage, Checking Rules, Editors, and Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the interpreter should be as easy as possible. Thus, we have to provide the appropriate utilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the interpreter from any BaseLanguage code.&lt;br /&gt;
We had to make sure we get language / model loading and dependencies right. This should be easier with Truffle than with the current interpreter, as most language dependencies are only required at interpreter build time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report interpreter results in Checking Rules.&lt;br /&gt;
Creating warnings or errors based on the interpreter’s results is a standard use-case, and should be supported by dedicated language constructs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show interpreter results in an editor.&lt;br /&gt;
As another standard use-case, we might want to show the interpreter’s results (or a derivative) inside an MPS editor. Especially for long-running or asynchronous calculations, getting this right is tricky. Dedicated editor extensions should take care of the details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run tests that involve the interpreter.&lt;br /&gt;
Yet another standard use-case: our DSL defines both calculation rules and examples. We want to assure they are in sync, meaning executing the rules in our DSL interpreter and comparing the results with the examples. This must work both inside MPS, and in a headless build / CI test environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_8_support_asynchronous_interpretation_andor_caching&quot;&gt;Step 8: Support Asynchronous Interpretation and/or Caching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple implementation of interpreter support accepts a language, parameters, and a program (a.k.a. input model), and blocks until the interpretation is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This working mode is useful in various situations. However, we might want to run long-running interpretations in the background, and notify a callback once the computation is finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: An MPS editor uses an interpreter to color a rule red if it is not in accordance with a provided example. This interpretation result is very useful, even if it takes several seconds to calculate. However, we don’t want to block the editor (or even whole MPS) for that long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending the example, we might also want to show an error on such a rule. The typesystem runs asynchronously anyways, so blocking is not an issue. However, we now run the same expensive interpretation twice. The interpreter support should provide configurable caching mechanisms to avoid such waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both asynchronous interpretation and caching benefit from proper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#plumbing&quot;&gt;language extensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_9_integrate_with_mps_typesystem_and_scoping&quot;&gt;Step 9: Integrate with MPS Typesystem and Scoping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truffle needs to know about our DSL’s types, e.g. for resolving overloaded functions or type casting. We already provide this information to the MPS typesystem. I didn’t look into the details yet; I’d expect we could generate at least part of the Truffle input from MPS’ type aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truffle requires scoping knowledge to store variables in the right stack frame (and possibly other things I don’t understand yet). I’d expect we could use the resolved references in our model as input to Truffle. I’m less optimistic to re-use MPS’ actual scoping system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both aspects, we can amend the missing information in the Interpreter Language, similar to the existing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_10_support_interpreter_development&quot;&gt;Step 10: Support Interpreter Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As DSL developers, we want to make sure we implemented our interpreter correctly. Thus, we write tests; they are similar to other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#plumbing&quot;&gt;tests involving the interpreter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if they fail, we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#debugger&quot;&gt;debug the program expressed in our DSL&lt;/a&gt;, but our interpreter. For example, we might implement the interpreter for a &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt;-like construct, and had forgotten to handle an implicit &lt;tt&gt;default&lt;/tt&gt; case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a regular Java debugger (attached to our running MPS instance) has only limited use, as we had to debug through the highly optimized Truffle code. We cannot use Truffle’s debugging capabilities, as they work on the DSL.&lt;br /&gt;
There might be ways to attach a regular Java debugger running inside MPS in a different thread to its own JVM. Combining the direct debugger access with our knowledge of the interpreter’s structure, we might be able to provide sensible stepping through the interpreter to the DSL developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simpler ways to support the developers might be providing traces through the interpreter, or ship test support where the DSL developer can assure specific evaluators were (not) executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_11_create_language_for_interop&quot;&gt;Step 11: Create Language for Interop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truffle provides a framework to describe any runtime in-memory data structure as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/object/Shape.html&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Shape&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and to convert them between languages. This should be a nice extension of MPS’ multi-language support into the runtime space, supported by an appropriate Meta-DSL (a.k.a. language aspect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_part_iii_leverage_programming_language_tooling&quot;&gt;Part III: Leverage Programming Language Tooling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;debugger&quot;&gt;Step 12: Connect Truffle to MPS’ Debugger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPS contains the standard interactive debugger inherited from IntelliJ platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truffle exposes a standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/debug/DebuggerSession.html&quot;&gt;interface for interactive debuggers&lt;/a&gt; of the interpreted input. It takes care of the heavy lifting from Truffle AST to MPS input node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we ran Truffle in a different thread than the MPS debugger, we should manage to connect both parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;instrumentation&quot;&gt;Step 13: Integrate Instrumentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truffle also exposes an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/instrumentation/TruffleInstrument.html&quot;&gt;instrumentation interface&lt;/a&gt;. We could provide standard instrumentation applications like “code” coverage (in our case: DSL node coverage) and tracing out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might think of nice visualizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color node background based on coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark the currently executed part of the model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project runtime values inline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show traces in trace explorer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other possible applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snapshot mechanism for current interpreter state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide traces for offline debugging, and play them back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_part_iv_beyond_mps&quot;&gt;Part IV: Beyond MPS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_14_serialize_truffle_nodes&quot;&gt;Step 14: Serialize Truffle Nodes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we could serialize Truffle &lt;tt&gt;Node&lt;/tt&gt;s (before any run-time optimization), we would have an MPS-independent representation of the executable DSL. Depending on the serialization format (implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/io/Serializable.html&quot;&gt;Serializable&lt;/a&gt;, custom binary format, JSON, etc.), we could optimize for use-case, size, loading time, or other priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_15_execute_dsl_stand_alone_without_generator&quot;&gt;Step 15: Execute DSL stand-alone without Generator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume an insurance calculation DSL.&lt;br /&gt;
Usually, we would implement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an interpreter to execute test cases within MPS,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Generator to C to execute on the production server,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and a Generator to Java to provide an preview for the insurance agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With serialized Truffle &lt;tt&gt;Node&lt;/tt&gt;s, we need only one interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It runs out-of-the-box in MPS,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works stand-alone through GraalVM’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/substratevm&quot;&gt;ahead-of-time compiler Substrate VM&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and can be used on any JVM using Truffle runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;_part_v_crazy_ideas&quot;&gt;Part V: Crazy Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-back&quot;&gt;Step 16: Step Back Debugger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#instrumentation&quot;&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#debugger&quot;&gt;debugger&lt;/a&gt;, it might be feasible to provide step-back debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interpreter, we know the complete global state of the program, and can store deltas (to reduce memory usage). For quite some DSLs, this might be sufficient to store every intermediate state and thus arbitrary debug movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;side-step&quot;&gt;Step 17: Side Step Debugger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#step-back&quot;&gt;stepping back&lt;/a&gt; through our execution and following different execution paths, we could explore alternate outcomes. The different execution path might stem from other input values, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#translate-input-model&quot;&gt;hot code replacement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;_step_18_explorative_simulations&quot;&gt;Step 18: Explorative Simulations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#side-step&quot;&gt;side step debugger&lt;/a&gt;, nice support to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#plumbing&quot;&gt;project interpretation results&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nikostotz.de/blog/feed/#migrate-framework&quot;&gt;really fast interpreter&lt;/a&gt;, we could run explorative simulations on lots of different executions paths. This might enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/36579366#t=10m20s&quot;&gt;legendary interactive development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Denis Roy: Postmortem - February 7 storage and authentication outage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">6774 at https://blogs.eclipse.org</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/denis-roy/postmortem-february-7-storage-and-authentication-outage</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On Friday, February 7 2020, Eclipse.org suffered a severe service disruption to many of its web properties when our primary authentication server and file server suffered a hardware failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 90 minutes, our main website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org&quot;&gt;www.eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;, was mostly available, as was our Bugzilla bug tracking tool, but logging in was not possible. Wiki, Eclipse Marketplace and other web properties were degraded. Git and Gerrit were both completely offline for 2 hours and 18 minutes. Authenticated access to Jiro -- our Jenkins+Kubernetes-based CI system, was not possible, and builds that relied on Git access failed during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no data loss, but there were data inconsistencies. A dozen Git repositories and Gerrit code changes were in an inconsistent state due to replication schedules, but thanks to the distributed nature of Git, the code commits were still in local developer Git repositories, as well as on the failed server, which we were eventually able to revive (in an offline environment). Data inconsistencies were more severe in our LDAP accounts database, where dozens of users were unable to log in, and in some isolated cases, users reported that their account was reverted back to old data from years prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, we feel this outage could have, and should have been avoided. We’ve identified many measures we must enact to prevent such unplanned outages in the future. Furthermore, our communication and incident handling processes proved to be flawed, and will be scrutinized and improved, to ensure our community is better informed during unplanned incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we’ve identified aging hardware and Single Points of Failure (SPoF) that must be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File server &amp;amp; authentication setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;At the center of the Eclipse infra is a pair of servers that handle 2 specific tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Network Attached Storage (NAS) via NFS&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;User Authentication via OpenLDAP&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server pair consists of a primary system, which handles all the traffic, and a hot spare. Both servers are configured identically for production service, but the spare server sits idly and receives data periodically from the primary. This specific architecture was originally implemented in 2005, with periodical hardware upgrades over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline of events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday Feb 7 - 12:33pm EST:&lt;/strong&gt; Fred Gurr (Eclipse Foundation IT/Releng team) reports on the Foundation’s internal Slack channel that something is happening to the Infra. Denis observes many “Flaky” status reports on &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.eclipse.org&quot;&gt;https://status.eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt; but is in transit and cannot investigate further. Webmaster Matt Ward investigates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:43pm: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt confirms that our primary nfs/ldap server is not responding, and activates “Plan A: assess and fix”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:59pm: &lt;/strong&gt;Denis reaches a computer and activates “Plan B: prepare for Failover” while Matt works on Plan A. The “Sorry, we are down” page is served for all Flaky services except &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org&quot;&gt;www.eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;, which continues to be served successfully by our nginx cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:18pm: &lt;/strong&gt;The standby server is ready to assume the “primary” role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:29pm: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt makes the call for failover, as the severity of the hardware failure is not known, and not easily recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:49pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org&quot;&gt;www.eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;, Bugzilla, Marketplace, Wiki return to stable service on the new primary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:18pm: &lt;/strong&gt;Git and Gerrit return to stable service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:42pm: &lt;/strong&gt;Our Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster is updated to the latest patchlevel and all CI services restarted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:47pm: &lt;/strong&gt;All legacy JIPP servers are restarted, and all other remaining services report functional.  At this time, we are not aware of any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the weekend, Matt continues to monitor the infra. Authentication issues crop up over the weekend, which are caused by duplicated accounts and are fixed by Matt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, 4:49am EST: &lt;/strong&gt;Mikaël Barbero (Eclipse Foundation IT/Releng team) reports that there are more duplicate users in LDAP that cannot log into our systems. This is now a substantial issue. They are fixed systematically with an LDAP duplicate finder, but the process is very slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:37am: &lt;/strong&gt;First Foundation broadcast on the cross-project mailing list that there is an issue with authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, 9:51am: &lt;/strong&gt;Denis blogs about the incident and posts a message to the eclipse.org-committers mailing list about the ongoing authentication issues. The message, however, is held for moderation and is not distributed until many hours later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Later that day: &lt;/strong&gt;Most duplicated accounts have been removed, and just about everything is stabilized. We do not yet understand the source of the duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday: &lt;/strong&gt;duplicate removals continue, as well as investigation into the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday 9:52am: &lt;/strong&gt;We file a dozen bugs against projects whose Git and Gerrit repos may be out of sync. Some projects had already re-pushed or rebased their missing code patches and resolved the issue as FIXED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, 2:58pm: &lt;/strong&gt;All remaining duplicates are removed. Our LDAP database is fully cleaned. The failed server re-enters production as the hot standby - even though its hardware is not reliable. New hardware is sourced and ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical servers assuming our NAS/LDAP setup are server-class hardware, 2U chassis with redundant power supplies, ECC (error checking and correction) memory, RAID-5 disk arrays with a battery-backup RAID controller memory. Both primary and standby servers were put into production in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 7, the primary server experienced a kernel crash from the RAID controller module. The RAID controller detected an unrecoverable ECC memory error. The entire server became unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As originally designed in 2005, periodical (batched) data updates from the primary to the hot spare were simple to set up and maintain. This method also had a distinct advantage over live replication: rapid recovery in case of erasure (accidental or malicious) or data tampering. Of course, this came at a cost of possible data loss. However, it was deemed that critical data (in our case, Source Code) susceptible to loss during the short time was also available on developer workstations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Failover and return to stability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As the standby server was prepared for production service, the reasons for the crash on the primary server were investigated. We assessed the possibility of continuing service on the primary; that course of action would have provided the fastest recovery with the fewest surprises later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the nature of the hardware failure remained unknown, failover was the only option. We confirmed that some data replication tasks had run less than one hour prior to failure, and all data replication was completed no later than 3 hours prior. IP addresses were updated, and one by one, services that depended on NFS and authentication were restarted to flush caches and minimize any potential for an inconsistent state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 4:30pm, or four hours after the failure, both webmasters were confident that the failover was successful, and that very little dust would settle over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Throughout the weekend, we had a few reports of authentication issues -- which were expected, since we failed over to a standby authentication source that was at least 12 hours behind the primary. These issues were fixed as they were reported, and nothing seemed out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, Feb 10th, the Foundation’s Releng team reported that several committers had authentication issues to the CI systems. We then suspected that something else was at play with our authentication database, but it was not clear to us what had happened, or what the magnitude was. The common issue was duplicate accounts -- some users had an account in two separate containers simultaneously, which prevented users from being able to authenticate. These duplicates were removed as rapidly as we could, and we wrote scripts to identify old duplicates and purge them -- but with &amp;gt;450,000 accounts, it was time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, we got so wrapped up in trying to understand and resolve the issue that we completely underestimated its impact on the community, and we were absolutely silent about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem solved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On Friday afternoon, February 14, we were able to finally clean up all the duplicate accounts and understand why they existed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to December, 2011, our LDAP database only contained committer accounts. In December 2011, we imported all the non-committer accounts from Bugzilla and Wiki into an LDAP container we named “Community”. This allowed us to centralize authentication around a single source of truth: LDAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All new accounts were, and are created in the Community container, and are moved into the Committer container if/when they became an Eclipse Committer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our primary-&amp;gt;secondary LDAP sync mechanism was altered, at that time, to sync the Community container as well -- but it was purely additive. Once you had an account in Community, it was there for life on the standby server, even if you became a committer later on. Or if you’d ever change your email address. This was the source of the duplicate accounts on the standby server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new server pair has been ordered on February 14, 2020 . These servers will be put into production service as soon as possible, and the old hardware will be recommissioned to clustered service. With these new machines, we believe our existing architecture and configuration can continue to serve us well over the coming months and years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take-aways and proposed improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the outage didn’t last incredibly long (2 hours from failure to the beginning of restored service), we feel it shouldn’t have occurred in the first place. Furthermore, we’ve identified key areas where our processes can be improved - notably, in how we communicate with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the action items we’re committed to implementing in the near term, to improve our handling of such incidents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication: &lt;/strong&gt;Improved Service Status page.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.eclipse.org&quot;&gt;https://status.eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt; gives a picture of what’s going on, but with an improved service, we can communicate the nature of outages, the impact, and estimated time until service is restored.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication: &lt;/strong&gt;Internally, we will improve communication within our team and establish a maintenance log, whereby members of the team can discover the work that has been done.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staffing: &lt;/strong&gt;we will explore the possibility of an additional IT hire, thus enhancing our collective skillset, and enabling more overall time on the quality and reliability of the infra.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging Hardware: &lt;/strong&gt;we will put top-priority on resolving aging SPoF, and be more strict about not running hardware devices past their reasonable life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
		&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the longer term, we will continue our investment in replacing SPoF with more robust technologies. This applies to authentication, storage, databases and networking.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process and procedures: &lt;/strong&gt;we will allocate more time to testing our disaster recovery and business continuity procedures. Such tests would likely have revealed the LDAP sync bug.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that these steps will significantly reduce unplanned outages such as the one that occured on February 7. They will also help us ensure that, should a failure occur, we recover and return to a state of stability more rapidly. Finally, they will help you understand what is happening, and what the timelines to restore service are, so that you can plan your work tasks and remain productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Stephan Herrmann: Interfacing null-safe code with legacy code</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://objectteams.wordpress.com/?p=685</guid>
	<link>https://objectteams.wordpress.com/2020/02/06/interfacing-null-safe-code-with-legacy-code/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When you adopt null annotations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.eclipse.org/2019-12/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jdt/annotation/package-summary.html?cp=3_1_0_9&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;, your ultimate hope is that the compiler will tell you about &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; possible NullPointerException (NPE) in your program (except for tricks like reflection or bytecode weaving etc.). Hallelujah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most of us use libraries which don’t have the blessing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.eclipse.org/2019-12/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-using_null_type_annotations.htm?cp=1_3_9_1&quot;&gt;annotation based null analysis&lt;/a&gt;, simply because those are not annotated appropriately (neither in source nor using &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.eclipse.org/2019-12/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-using_external_null_annotations.htm?cp=1_3_9_2&quot;&gt;external annotations&lt;/a&gt;). Let’s for now call such code: &lt;strong&gt;“legacy”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will walk through the options to warn you about the risks incurred by legacy code. The general theme will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we assert that no NPE will happen &lt;strong&gt;in null-checked code&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.e., if your code consistently uses null annotations, and has passed analysis without warnings, can we be sure that NPEs can only ever be thrown in the legacy part of the code?&lt;em&gt; (NPEs inside legacy code are still to be expected, there’s nothing we can change about that)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using existing Eclipse versions, one category of problems would still go undetected whereby null-checked code could still throw NPE. &lt;strong&gt;This has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=482242&quot;&gt;recently fixed &lt;img alt=&quot;bug&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-691&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; src=&quot;https://objectteams.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/bug.png&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simple data flows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with simple data flows, e.g., when your program obtains a value from legacy code, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;NullFrom_getProperty&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-690&quot; height=&quot;438&quot; src=&quot;https://objectteams.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/nullfrom_getproperty.png&quot; width=&quot;737&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t be surprised, the javadoc even says: “&lt;em&gt;The method returns &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if the property is not found.&lt;/em&gt;” While the compiler doesn’t read javadoc, it can recognize that a value with unspecified nullness flows into a variable with a non-null type. Hence the warning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Null type safety (type annotations): The expression of type ‘String’ needs unchecked conversion to conform to ‘@NonNull String’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the compiler warned us, so we are urged to fix the problem in our code. Conversely, if we pass any value &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; a legacy API, all bad that can happen would happen inside legacy code, so nothing to be done for our mentioned goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying rule is: legacy values can be safely &lt;strong&gt;assigned&lt;/strong&gt; to nullable variables, but not to non-null variables (example &lt;code&gt;Properties.getProperty()&lt;/code&gt;). On the other hand, &lt;em&gt;any value&lt;/em&gt; can be assigned to a legacy variable (or method argument).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put differently: values flowing from null-checked to legacy pose no problems, whereas values flowing the opposite direction must be assumed to be nullable, to avoid problems in null-checked code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter generics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here be dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a minimum requirement we now need &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.eclipse.org/2019-12/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-using_null_type_annotations.htm?cp=1_3_9_1&quot;&gt;null annotations with target TYPE_USE&lt;/a&gt; (“type annotations”), but we have this since 2014. Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;NullFromLegacyList&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-692&quot; height=&quot;574&quot; src=&quot;https://objectteams.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/nullfromlegacylist.png&quot; width=&quot;736&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we obtain a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; value from a &lt;code&gt;Legacy&lt;/code&gt; class, where indeed the list &lt;code&gt;names&lt;/code&gt; is non-null (as can be seen by successful output from &lt;code&gt;names.size()&lt;/code&gt;). Still things are going south in our code, because the list contained an unexpected &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect us from this problem, I marked the entire class as &lt;code&gt;@NonNullByDefault&lt;/code&gt;, which causes the type of the variable &lt;code&gt;names&lt;/code&gt; to become &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;@NonNull String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Now the compiler can again warn us about an unsafe assignment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Null type safety (type annotations): The expression of type ‘List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;’ needs unchecked conversion to conform to ‘List&amp;lt;@NonNull String&amp;gt;’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This captures the situation, where a null value is passed from legacy to null-checked code, which is wrapped in a non-null container value (the list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a tricky question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it safe to pass a null-checked value of a parameterized type into legacy code?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of simple values, we saw no problem, but the following example tells us otherwise once generics are involved:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;NullIntoNonNullList&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-693&quot; src=&quot;https://objectteams.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/nullintononnulllist.png&quot; width=&quot;736&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we have a list of type &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;@NonNull String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so dereferencing values obtained from that list should never throw NPE. Unfortunately, the legacy method &lt;code&gt;printNames()&lt;/code&gt; succeeded to break our contract by inserting &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; into the list, resulting in yet another NPE thrown in null-checked code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To describe this situation it helps to draw boundaries not only between null-checked and legacy &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;, but also to draw a boundary around the null-checked &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of parameterized type &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;@NonNull String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. That boundary is breached when we pass this value into legacy code, because that code will only see &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and happily invoke &lt;code&gt;add(null)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is were I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=482242&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; invented a new diagnostic message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsafe null type conversion (type annotations): The value of type ‘List&amp;lt;@NonNull String&amp;gt;’ is made accessible using the less-annotated type ‘List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By passing &lt;code&gt;names&lt;/code&gt; into legacy code, we enable a &lt;em&gt;hidden&lt;/em&gt; data flow in the opposite direction. In the general case, this introduces the risk of NPE in otherwise null-checked code. Always?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildcards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java would be a much simpler language without wildcards, but a closer look reveals that wildcards actually don’t only help for type safety but also for null-safety. How so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the legacy method were written using a wildcard, it would not be (easily) possible to sneak in a &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; value, here are two attempts:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;SneakAttempts&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-697&quot; height=&quot;125&quot; src=&quot;https://objectteams.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/sneakattempts-1.png&quot; width=&quot;532&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first attempt is an outright Java type error. The second triggers a warning from Eclipse, despite the lack of null annotations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Null type mismatch (type annotations): ‘null’ is not compatible to the free type variable ‘?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, compiling the legacy class without null-checking would still bypass our detection, but chances are already better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we add an &lt;em&gt;upper bound&lt;/em&gt; to the wildcard, like in &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;? extends CharSequence&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, not much is changed. A &lt;em&gt;lower bound&lt;/em&gt;, however, is an invitation for the legacy code to insert &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; at whim: &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;? super String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will cause &lt;code&gt;names.add()&lt;/code&gt; to accept any String, including the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; value. That’s why Eclipse will also complain against lower bounded wildcards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsafe null type conversion (type annotations): The value of type ‘List&amp;lt;@NonNull String&amp;gt;’ is made accessible using the less-annotated type ‘List&amp;lt;? super String&amp;gt;’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comparing to raw types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested to treat legacy (not null-annotated) types like raw types. Both are types with a part of the contract ignored, thereby causing risks for parts of the program that still rely on the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, raw types are more permissive in the parameterized-to-raw conversion. We are generally not protected against legacy code inserting an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; when passed as a raw &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, using a raw type as a type argument produces an outright Java type error, so my final attempt at hacking the type system failed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;RawTypeArgument&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-698&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; src=&quot;https://objectteams.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/rawtypeargument-1.png&quot; width=&quot;738&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen several kinds of data flow with different risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple values flowing &lt;em&gt;checked-to-legacy&lt;/em&gt; don’t cause any specific headache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple values flowing &lt;em&gt;legacy-to-checked&lt;/em&gt; should be treated as nullable to avoid bad surprises. This is checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Values of parameterized type flowing &lt;em&gt;legacy-to-checked&lt;/em&gt; must be handled with care at the receiving side. This is checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Values of parameterized type flowing &lt;em&gt;checked-to-legacy&lt;/em&gt; add more risks, depending on:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nullness of the type argument (&lt;code&gt;@Nullable&lt;/code&gt; type argument has no risk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presence of wildcards, unbounded or lower-bounded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipse can detect all mentioned situations that would cause NPE to be thrown from null-checked code – the capstone to be released with Eclipse 2020-03, i.e., coming soon …&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Lorenzo Bettini: Remove SNAPSHOT and Qualifier in Maven/Tycho Builds</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.lorenzobettini.it/?p=1259</guid>
	<link>http://www.lorenzobettini.it/2020/02/remove-snapshot-and-qualifier-in-maven-tycho-builds/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Before releasing Maven artifacts, you remove the &lt;strong&gt;-SNAPSHOT&lt;/strong&gt; from your POMs. If you develop Eclipse projects and build with Maven and Tycho, you have to keep the versions in the POMs and the versions in MANIFEST, feature.xml and other Eclipse project artifacts consistent. Typically when you release an Eclipse p2 site, you don’t remove the &lt;strong&gt;.qualifier&lt;/strong&gt; in the versions and you will get Eclipse bundles and features versions automatically processed: the .qualifer is replaced with a timestamp. But if you want to release some Eclipse bundles also as Maven artifacts (e.g., to Maven central) you have to remove the -SNAPSHOT before deploying (or they will still be considered snapshots, of course &lt;img alt=&quot;ðŸ™‚&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt; and you have to remove .qualifier in Eclipse bundles accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, in an automatic way, you can use a combination of Maven plugins and of &lt;em&gt;tycho-versions-plugin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to show two different ways of doing that. The example used in this post can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/tycho-set-version-example&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/tycho-set-version-example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;First method&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to use the goal &lt;strong&gt;parse-version&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;org.codehaus.mojo:build-helper-maven-plugin&lt;/strong&gt;. This will store the parts of the current version in some properties (by default, &lt;em&gt;parsedVersion.majorVersion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;parsedVersion.minorVersion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;parsedVersion.incrementalVersion&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we can pass these properties appropriately to the goal &lt;strong&gt;set-version&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Maven command to run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;mvn \
  build-helper:parse-version org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin:set-version \
  -DnewVersion=\${parsedVersion.majorVersion}.\${parsedVersion.minorVersion}.\${parsedVersion.incrementalVersion}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goalÂ &lt;em&gt;set-version&lt;/em&gt; of the Tycho plugin will take care of updating the versions (without the -SNAPSHOT and .qualifier) both in POMs and in Eclipse projects’ metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Second method&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, we can use the goalÂ &lt;strong&gt;set&lt;/strong&gt; (with argument &lt;em&gt;-DremoveSnapshot=true&lt;/em&gt;) of the &lt;strong&gt;org.codehaus.mojo:versions-maven-plugin&lt;/strong&gt;. Then, we use the goal &lt;strong&gt;update-eclipse-metadata&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin&lt;/strong&gt;, to update Eclipse projects’ versions according to the version in the POM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Maven command to run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;mvn \
  versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DremoveSnapshot=true \
  org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin:update-eclipse-metadata&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first goal will change the versions in POMs while the second one will change the versions in Eclipse projects’ metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Configuring the plugins&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, it’s best practice to configure the used plugins (in this case, their versions) in theÂ &lt;em&gt;pluginManagement&lt;/em&gt; section of your parent POM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the parent POM of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/tycho-set-version-example&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/tycho-set-version-example&lt;/a&gt; we have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;build&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;pluginManagement&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.codehaus.mojo&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;build-helper-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;3.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.codehaus.mojo&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;versions-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.7&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.eclipse.tycho&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;tycho-versions-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;1.6.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
...&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, choose the method you prefer. Please keep in mind that these goals are not meant to be used during a standard Maven lifecycle, that’s why we ran them explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the goalÂ &lt;strong&gt;set&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;org.codehaus.mojo:versions-maven-plugin&lt;/strong&gt; might give you some headache if the structure of your Maven/Eclipse projects is quite different from the default one based on nested directories. In particular, if you have an aggregator project different from the parent project, you will have to pass additional arguments or set the versions in different commands (e.g., first on the parent, then on the other modules of the aggregator, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Jeremie Bresson: JDT without Eclipse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2020/2020-01-17_jdt-without-eclipse.html</guid>
	<link>https://jmini.github.io/blog/2020/2020-01-17_jdt-without-eclipse.html</link>
	<description>&lt;div id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt; 
 &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/&quot;&gt;JDT&lt;/a&gt; (Java Development Tools) is an important part of Eclipse IDE but it can also be used without Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;For example the Spring Tools 4, which is nowadays a cross-platform tool (Visual Studio Code, Eclipse IDE, …), is highly using the JDT behind the scene. If you would like to know more, I recommend you this podcast episode: &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/a-bootiful-podcast/spring-tools-lead-martin-lippert&quot;&gt;Spring Tools lead Martin Lippert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;A second known example is the Java Formatter that is also part of the JDT. Since a long time there are maven and gradle plugins that performs the same formatting as Eclipse IDE but as part of the build (often with the possibly to break the build when the code is wrongly formatted).&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;Reusing the JDT has been made easier since 2017 when it was decided to publish each release and its dependencies on maven central (with following &lt;code&gt;groupId&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;org.eclipse.jdt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;org.eclipse.platform&lt;/code&gt;). Stephan Herrmann did a lot of work to achieve this goal. I blogged about this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://jmini.github.io/blog/2017/2017-01-10_use-eclipse-jdt-in-java-app.html&quot;&gt;Use the Eclipse Java Development Tools in a Java SE application&lt;/a&gt; and I have pushed a simple example the Java Formatter is used in a simple &lt;code&gt;main(String[])&lt;/code&gt; method built by a classic minimal Maven project: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jmini/jdt-experiments/tree/master/java-formatter&quot;&gt;java-formatter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt; 
 &lt;h2 id=&quot;workspace_or_not&quot;&gt;Workspace or not?&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;When using the JDT in an headless application, two cases needs to be distinguished:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;olist arabic&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;ol class=&quot;arabic&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some features (the parser, the formatter…) can be used in a simple Java main method.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other features (search index, AST rewriter…) require a workspace. This imply that the code run inside an OSGi runtime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;/ol&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this aspect, I took some of the examples provided by the site &lt;code&gt;www.programcreek.com&lt;/code&gt; in the blog post series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.programcreek.com/2011/01/best-java-development-tooling-jdt-and-astparser-tutorials/&quot;&gt;Eclipse JDT Tutorials&lt;/a&gt; and I adapted them so that each code snippet can be executed inside a JUnit test. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jmini.github.io/jdt-experiments/#programcreek-examples&quot;&gt;Programcreek examples&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;I have split the unit-tests into two projects:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;ul&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;programcreek-standalone&lt;/code&gt; for the one that do not require OSGi. The maven project is really simple (using the default convention everywhere)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;programcreek-osgi&lt;/code&gt; for the one that must run inside an OSGi runtime. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/tree/master/maven/bnd-maven-plugin&quot;&gt;bnd maven plugins&lt;/a&gt; are configured in the &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; to take care of the OSGi stuff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;/ul&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;If you run the test with Maven, it will work out-of-the box.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;If you would like to run them inside an IDE, you should use one that starts OSGi when executing the tests (in the same way the maven build is doing it). To get a bnd aware IDE, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-12/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers&quot;&gt;Eclipse IDE for Java Developers&lt;/a&gt; with the additional plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://bndtools.org/&quot;&gt;Bndtools&lt;/a&gt; installed, but there are other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;p&gt;Source code can be found on GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jmini/jdt-experiments/tree/master/programcreek-examples&quot;&gt;programcreek-examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Chris Aniszczyk: 4 Years at The Linux Foundation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.aniszczyk.org/?p=4328</guid>
	<link>https://www.aniszczyk.org/2020/01/03/4-years-at-the-linux-foundation/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Late last year marked the 4th year anniversary of the formation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cncf.io/&quot;&gt;CNCF&lt;/a&gt; and me joining The Linux Foundation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;… this also marks 4+ years since I joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/linuxfoundation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@linuxfoundation&lt;/a&gt;, after experiencing crazy startup growth/success at Twitter, I was looking for something more NOT startup… was somewhat suckered in by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jzemlin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jzemlin&lt;/a&gt; to join a &quot;chill, totally not like a startup&quot; nonprofit… &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/S3f5jmyqoT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/S3f5jmyqoT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Chris Aniszczyk (@cra) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cra/status/1205147194673762304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 12, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter 2020, it’s amusing for me to reflect on my decision to join The Linux Foundation a little over 4 years ago when I was looking for something new to focus on. I spent about 5 years at Twitter which felt like an eternity (the average tenure for a silicon valley employee is &lt;a href=&quot;https://workology.com/ep-31-employee-tenure-of-silicon-valleys-hottest-tech-companies/&quot;&gt;under 2 years&lt;/a&gt;), focused on open source and enjoyed the startup life of going from a hundred or so engineers to a couple of thousand. I truly enjoyed the ride, it was a high impact experience where we were able to open source projects that changed the industry for the better: &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; (changed front end development for the better), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twemoji.twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Twemoji&lt;/a&gt; (made emojis more open source friendly and embeddable), &lt;a href=&quot;http://mesos.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Mesos&lt;/a&gt; (pushed the state of art for open source infrastructure), co-founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://todogroup.org&quot;&gt;TODO Group&lt;/a&gt; (pushed the state of corporate open source programs forward) and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was looking for change, I wanted to find an opportunity that could impact more than I could just do at one company. I had some offers from FAANG companies and amazing startups but eventually settled on the nonprofit Linux Foundation because I wanted to build an open source foundation from scratch, teach other companies about open source best practices and assumed non profit life would be a bit more relaxing than diving into a new company (&lt;strong&gt;I was wrong)&lt;/strong&gt;. Also, I was throughly &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: inherit;&quot;&gt;convinced that an openly governed foundation pushing Kubernetes, container specifications and adjacent independent cloud native technologies would be the right model to move open infrastructure forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter 2020, I realize that I’ve been with one organization for a long time and that puts me on edge as I enjoy challenges, chaos and dread anything that makes me comfortable or complacent. Also, I have a strong desire to focus on efforts that involve improving the state of security and privacy in a connected world, participatory democracy, climate change; also anything that pushes open source to new industries and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m always happy to entertain opportunities that align to my goals, the one thing that I do enjoy at the LF is that I’ve had the ability to build a variety of new open source foundations improving industries and communities: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cd.foundation/&quot;&gt;CDF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundation.graphql.org&quot;&gt;GraphQL Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencontainers.org/&quot;&gt;Open Container Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (OCI), &lt;a href=&quot;https://prestodb.io&quot;&gt;Presto Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://todogroup.org&quot;&gt;TODO Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uc.foundation&quot;&gt;Urban Computing Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, thanks for reading and I look forward to another year of bringing open source practices to new industries and places, the world is better when we are collaborating openly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Jens Reimann: An update on Eclipse IoT Packages</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dentrassi.de/?p=4373</guid>
	<link>https://dentrassi.de/2019/12/19/update-on-eclipse-iot-packages/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened, since &lt;a href=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/2019/09/10/from-building-blocks-to-iot-solutions/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I wrote last about the Eclipse IoT Packages project&lt;/a&gt;. We had some great discussions at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2019&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EclipseCon Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and started to work together online, having new ideas in the progress. Right before the end of the year, I think it is a good time to give an update, and peek a bit into the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Homepage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the first things we wanted to get started, was a home for the content we plan on creating. An important piece of the puzzle is to explain to people, what we have in mind. Not only for people that want to try out the various Eclipse IoT projects, but also to possible contributors. And in the end, an important goal of the project is to attract interested parties. For consuming our ideas, or growing them even further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Eclipse IoT Packages logo&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4377&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/logo.svg&quot; width=&quot;453&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we now have a logo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/packages/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a homepage&lt;/a&gt;, built using using templates in a continuous build system. We are in a position to start focusing on the actual content, and on the more tricky tasks and questions ahead. And should you want to create a PR for the homepage, you are more than welcome. There is also already some content, explaining the main goals, the way we want to move forward, and demo of a first package: “Package Zero”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the homepage is a good entry point for people to learn about Eclipse IoT and packages, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/packages/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; is the home for the community. And having some great discussions on GitHub, quickly brought up the need for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/packages/issues/4&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a community call&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/packages/issues/6&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a more direct communication channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the project, come and join &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/packages/contribute/#join-the-community-call&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our bi-weekly community call&lt;/a&gt;. It is a quick, 30 minutes call at 16:00 CET, and open to everyone. Repeating every two weeks, starting 2019-12-02.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The URL to the call is: &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipse.zoom.us/j/317801130&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://eclipse.zoom.us/j/317801130&lt;/a&gt;. You can also subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/lu98p1vc1ed4itl7n9qno3oogc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics&quot;&gt;community calendar&lt;/a&gt; to get a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In between calls, we have a chat room &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitter.im/eclipse/packages&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eclipse/packages&lt;/a&gt; on Gitter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse IoT Helm Chart Repository&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest discussion we had, was around the question of how and were we want to host the Helm charts. We would prefer not to author them ourselves, but let the projects contribute them. After all, the IoT packages project has the goal of enabling you to install a whole set of Eclipse IoT projects, with only a few commands. So the focus is on the integration, and the expert knowledge required for creating project Helm chart, is in the actual projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other side, having a one-stop shop, for getting your Eclipse IoT Helm charts, sounds pretty convenient. So why not host our own Helm chart repository?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kiwigrid/helm-charts&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kiwigrid&lt;/a&gt;, who contributed a CI pipeline for validating charts, we could easily extend our existing homepage publishing job, to also publish Helm charts. As a first chart, we published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Ditto&lt;/a&gt; chart. And, as expected with Helm, installing it is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-columns&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/h1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4387&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; src=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/h1-1024x427.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-column&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/h2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4388&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; src=&quot;https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/h2-1024x427.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course having a single chart is only the first step. Publishing a single Helm charts isn’t that impressive. But getting an agreement on the community, getting the validation and publishing pipeline set up, attracting new contributors, that is definitely a big step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think that we now have a good foundation, for moving forward. We have a place called “home”, for documentation, code and community. And it looks like we have also been able to attract more people to the project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While our first package, “Package Zero”, still isn’t complete, it should be pretty close. Creating a first, joint deployment of Hono and Ditto is our immediate focus. And we will continue to work towards a first release of “Package Zero”. Finding a better name is still an item on the list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having this foundation in place also means, that the time is right, for you to think about contributing your own Eclipse IoT Package. Contributions are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Karsten Thoms: Eclipse m2e: How to use a WORKSPACE Maven installation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://kthoms.wordpress.com/?p=1027</guid>
	<link>https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2019/11/27/eclipse-m2e-how-to-use-a-workspace-maven-installation/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today a colleague of me asked me about the Maven Installations preference page in Eclipse. There is an entry &lt;tt&gt;WORKSPACE&lt;/tt&gt; there, which is disabled and shows &lt;tt&gt;NOT AVAILABLE&lt;/tt&gt;. He wanted to know how to enable a workspace installation of Maven.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1029&quot; height=&quot;433&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/screenshot-343.png?w=584&amp;amp;h=433&quot; width=&quot;584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we both did not find the documentation of the feature I digged into the m2e sources and found class &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/m2e-core/blob/releases/1.12/1.12.0.20190529-1916/org.eclipse.m2e.core/src/org/eclipse/m2e/core/internal/launch/MavenWorkspaceRuntime.java&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;MavenWorkspaceRuntime&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The relevant snippets are the method &lt;tt&gt;getMavenDistribution()&lt;/tt&gt; and the &lt;tt&gt;MAVEN_DISTRIBUTION&lt;/tt&gt; constant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;c-mrkdwn__pre&quot;&gt;private static final ArtifactKey MAVEN_DISTRIBUTION = new ArtifactKey(
      &quot;org.apache.maven&quot;, &quot;apache-maven&quot;, &quot;[3.0,)&quot;, null); //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$ //$NON-NLS-3$

...

protected IMavenProjectFacade getMavenDistribution() {
  try {
    VersionRange range = VersionRange.createFromVersionSpec(getDistributionArtifactKey().getVersion());
    for(IMavenProjectFacade facade : projectManager.getProjects()) {
      ArtifactKey artifactKey = facade.getArtifactKey();
      if(getDistributionArtifactKey().getGroupId().equals(artifactKey.getGroupId()) //
          &amp;amp;&amp;amp; getDistributionArtifactKey().getArtifactId().equals(artifactKey.getArtifactId())//
          &amp;amp;&amp;amp; range.containsVersion(new DefaultArtifactVersion(artifactKey.getVersion()))) {
        return facade;
      }
    }
  } catch(InvalidVersionSpecificationException e) {
    // can't happen
  }
  return null;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here you can see that m2e tries to look for workspace (Maven) projects and to find one the has the coordinates &lt;tt&gt;org.apache.maven:apache-maven:[3.0,)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the answer how to enable a WORKSPACE Maven installation is: Import the project &lt;tt&gt;apache-maven&lt;/tt&gt; into the workspace. And here is how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone Apache Maven from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/maven.git&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/maven.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optionally: check out a release tag
&lt;pre&gt;git checkout maven-3.6.3&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform &lt;em&gt;File / Import / Existing Maven Projects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Root Directory&lt;/em&gt; select the &lt;tt&gt;apache-maven&lt;/tt&gt; subfolder in your Maven clone location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you will have the project that m2e searches for in your workspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Maven Installations preference page lets you now select this distribution:&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>I’m happy to report that the Eclipse SDK integration builds starts in less than 5 seconds (~4900 ms) on my machine into an empty workspace.
IIRC this used to be around 9 seconds 2 years ago. 4.13 (which was already quite a bit improved used around 5800ms (6887ms with EGit and Marketplace).
For recent improvements in this release see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=550136
Thanks to everyone who contributed.</description>

	<description>Disclaimer 1: This blog post literally is a &quot;web log&quot;, i.e., it is my log about setting up a Jenkins machine with a job that is triggered on a Github pull request. A lot of parts have been described elsewhere, and I link to the sources I used here. I also know that nowadays (e.g., new Eclipse build infrastructure) you usually do that via docker -- but then you need to configure docker, in which</description>

	<title>Fabio Zadrozny: LiClipse 6.0.0 released</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7855001383687474475.post-1728353912076381023</guid>
	<link>http://liclipse.blogspot.com/2019/10/liclipse-600-released.html</link>
	<description>LiClipse 6.0.0 is now out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main changes is that many dependencies have been updated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it's now based on Eclipse 4.13 (2019-09), which is a pretty nice upgrade (in my day-to-day use I find it appears smoother than previous versions, although I know this sounds pretty subjective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- PyDev was updated to 7.4.0, so, Python 3.8 (which was just released) is now already supported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</description>

	<description>Finally we use a decent icon for Quick Access / Find Actions. This is now a button in the toolbar which allows you to trigger arbitrary commands in the Eclipse IDE.</description>
